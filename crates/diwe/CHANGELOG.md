## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `[checkers]` in `config.toml` and `schema::run_checkers`: external programs that take keys as JSON on stdin and return reports as JSON — IWE's plug interface for whatever checks the schema cannot express, assuming nothing about the program.
- `covers:` on `links` rules — every value of a frontmatter list must be a link satisfying the filter; `$this.frontmatter.<path>` descends into lists of mappings.
- `asserts` rules: per-document conditions that compare the document's own fields (`that: { stale_after: { $gt: $this.frontmatter.opened_at } }`).
- `$this.frontmatter.<path>` in `links` filters: the validated document's own frontmatter field.
- `when:` on `links` rules — a filter over the document itself; the rule applies only where it matches, so rules can be conditioned on the document's own frontmatter.

- `requires` rules in schema files: a section that must be present (`min`/`max` times) whenever the document satisfies a `when` filter over its own frontmatter and content; document-local, so checked on partial graphs too.
- `$this` and `$this.<Section>` in `links` `target`/`some` filters: the validated document's key and the distinct link targets inside one of its sections, resolved per document.
- `[invariants]` in `config.toml` (`Invariant { filter, expect, description }`) and `check_invariants`: graph-wide count checks with `$today`/`$today±Nd` date substitution, reported under `invariants/<name>`.
- `links` rules in schema files — an IWE extension stripped before the document validator runs: per rule a `within` scope, `min`/`max` on distinct link targets, `target` (every target must satisfy a document filter), `some` (at least one must), `reach` (scoped links must transitively reach a key), and a `description` hint. Graph-dependent checks are skipped for partial-graph (pending buffer) validation.

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.19.1...diwe-v0.20.0) - 2026-08-23

### Added
- `library_path_in` — resolves the library directory from a project root and a `Configuration`

### Changed
- The `validate_documents` family returns `ValidationRun` — the reports plus counts of validated documents and distinct schemas (was `Vec<KeyReport>`)
- `Configuration` and its nested option types reject unknown fields when deserialized (previously unknown keys were silently ignored)

## [0.19.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.19.0...diwe-v0.19.1) - 2026-08-14

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.18.1...diwe-v0.19.0) - 2026-08-07

### Added
- Negated glob patterns in `SchemaBinding::match` — a `!`-prefixed pattern unbinds keys an earlier pattern matched. `SchemaBindings::schemas_for` applies patterns in order and the last matching one decides, gitignore-style, so a later pattern can re-include what a `!` removed; `\!` escapes a literal leading `!`.

## [0.18.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.18.0...diwe-v0.18.1) - 2026-08-02

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.17.0...diwe-v0.18.0) - 2026-08-01

### Added
- `PathFilter` in the `fs` module — decides whether a path belongs to the library using the same hidden-file and ignore-file rules as `walk_md_paths`, so watching and the initial scan agree on which files count.
- `Bm25Index::avgdl_drift` — how far the corpus average document length has moved from the value the index was fit to.

### Changed
- `start_watcher` and `start_poll_watcher` skip hidden files and files excluded by `.gitignore` or `.ignore` (previously every file with a matching extension was reported).

### Fixed
- `Bm25Index` reuses document slots instead of abandoning one on every `upsert` and `remove`, so a long-lived index no longer grows with the number of edits made to it.
- `Bm25Index` re-fits its length normalization once the average document length drifts far enough from the fitted value, so incremental updates no longer score against stale corpus statistics.

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.16.0...diwe-v0.17.0) - 2026-07-28

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.15.0...diwe-v0.16.0) - 2026-07-26

### Added
- `watcher` module — `start_watcher` and `start_poll_watcher` watch a project directory and report each change as an `FsChange` (`Update`/`Remove`) to a caller-supplied handler, mapping paths to document keys and reading file contents. Shared by the LSP server and the MCP server.

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.14.0...diwe-v0.15.0) - 2026-07-22

### Added
- `stats::SimilarityIndex::with_threshold` — sets the match level used by `similar` and `pairs`, so one built index can answer queries at several levels.
- `stats::DEFAULT_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD` — the `0.85` match level used when no threshold is set.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.13.0...diwe-v0.14.0) - 2026-07-21

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.12.0...diwe-v0.13.0) - 2026-07-15

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/diwe-v0.11.0...diwe-v0.12.0) - 2026-07-12

### Added
- `config::RefsText` re-export and the `refs_text` field it sits on (`MarkdownOptions`/`DjotOptions`) — selects whether a markdown link's text is preserved (default) or normalized to the linked document's title.
- `stats` findings functions — `graph_findings` (whole-store orphan and dangling-link `Finding`s, discriminated by `Rule`) and `mutation_findings` (the same plus a similar-page check for the created/updated keys), with `orphan_keys` and the now-public `broken_links` behind them.
- `stats::SimilarityIndex` — a search index plus per-key token counts, built once per run (`SimilarityIndex::build`) and reused for `similar(key)` (near-identical pages for one key, as `stats::SimilarPage { key, score }`) and `pairs()` (every mutually-similar pair across the store, each once, computed concurrently). Duplicate detection uses mutual BM25 similarity with a token-size gate and a high threshold.
- `GraphStatistics.orphans` — the list of orphan keys behind the existing `orphaned_documents` count; `stats::KeyStatisticsReport` pairs a `KeyStatistics` with its similar pages. `index` pages (root `index` or any `<dir>/index`) are treated as intentional entry points and excluded from both the orphan list and the count.
- `search::Bm25Index` point-score API — `similar_to(key, floor)` (documents whose self-normalized score against `key`'s own embedding clears a floor, self excluded), `self_score(key)`, and `score_between(query_key, doc_key)`; `search_query::corpus_text` is now public.
- `[schemas]` config binding — `config::SchemaBinding` and `config::Patterns` types and the `Configuration.schemas` map bind document schemas to document keys by glob (a single glob or a list). The new `schema` module resolves and runs them: `schema::SchemaBindings` matches a key to its schema names, and `schema::validate_documents` compiles the bound schema files, validates a set of documents, and returns a `schema::KeyReport` per `(key, schema)` with violations.
- `schema::validate_pending_documents` (and `schema::validate_pending_documents_in`, which takes an explicit schemas directory) validate a set of pending `(Key, content)` documents against their bound schemas by building a throwaway graph, so a change can be checked before it is written. `schema::pending_from_changes` collects the touched documents from a `Changes` set, `schema::render_reports_text` renders a `KeyReport` list as text, and `config::schemas_dir_in` resolves the schemas directory under a given base path.
- `schema::validate_documents_against_file` — validate documents against one schema file directly, ignoring the `[schemas]` config bindings; reports are keyed by the file's stem.

### Changed
- `search` now orders tied scores deterministically (score descending, then key ascending); previously ties came back in arbitrary order.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- `diwe` is the IWE engine library carved out of `liwe`. It carries the app-facing layer: `find` (BM25 / fuzzy search), `retrieve` (document expansion with token budgeting), `stats`, `tokens`, `fs` (filesystem / workspace loading), `graph_from_path`, and the `.iwe/config.toml` mapping (`config::Configuration`, `config::load_config`). It depends on `liwe` for the document kernel and re-exports `liwe`'s format/option types from `diwe::config`.
- `search` (the BM25 index) and `search_query` (BM25 + fuzzy resolvers, RRF fusion, `build_index`, `ranked` / `matched`, and an `execute` wrapper that resolves a query's `search` clause into scores and injects them into the `liwe` engine). `DocumentFinder::with_index` takes a caller-built index.
- `fs::apply_changes` — write a `Changes` set to a workspace (creates, updates, and removals), pruning any parent directories left empty by a removal.
