# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.24.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.23.2...iwes-v0.24.0) - 2026-09-08

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.23.2](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.23.1...iwes-v0.23.2) - 2026-09-08

### Fixed
- `textDocument/formatting` no longer turns a wrapped paragraph into a list, quote, heading, code block or HTML when `wrap_column` moves a marker such as `-`, `#`, `>`, `1.`, ```` ``` ````, `~~~`, `<div>` or a lone `---` to the start of a line — those markers are escaped now, and the HTML case used to drop the rest of the paragraph

## [0.23.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.23.0...iwes-v0.23.1) - 2026-09-06

### Fixed
- Go-to-definition, hover and code actions skip links with a URI scheme (`tel:`, `ftp:`, `file:`, …) instead of treating them as document references
- Wikilinks resolve regardless of case, so `[[target]]` opens `Target.md`
- `textDocument/formatting` keeps existing line breaks when `wrap_column` and `preserve_newlines` are both set (the two options together used to collapse a paragraph into a single reflowed block)
- `textDocument/formatting` applies `preserve_newlines` and `wrap_column` to djot documents, which previously ignored both
- `textDocument/formatting` no longer turns an escaped block marker at the start of a djot paragraph (`\- `, `\# `, `\> `, `1\. `, `\|`) into a real list, heading, quote or table

## [0.23.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.22.0...iwes-v0.23.0) - 2026-08-30

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.21.0...iwes-v0.22.0) - 2026-08-29

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.21.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.20.1...iwes-v0.21.0) - 2026-08-29

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.20.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.20.0...iwes-v0.20.1) - 2026-08-24

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.19.1...iwes-v0.20.0) - 2026-08-23

### Changed
- The server refuses to start when `.iwe/config.toml` contains unknown keys, reporting the parse error (previously unknown keys were silently ignored)

## [0.19.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.19.0...iwes-v0.19.1) - 2026-08-14

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.18.1...iwes-v0.19.0) - 2026-08-07

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.18.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.18.0...iwes-v0.18.1) - 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- Links to a hub document in a parent directory keep their target when a document is reformatted — a link from `a/b.md` to `a.md` stays `../a` (previously it was emptied).
- Renaming a document updates links inside table cells, which used to keep pointing at the old document.

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.17.0...iwes-v0.18.0) - 2026-08-01

### Fixed
- Bulk filesystem changes no longer stall the server. Adding or deleting many files at once — for example when a package manager rewrites a dependency tree — rebuilds the search index once for the whole batch instead of once per file, turning an operation that ran for minutes at full CPU into one that finishes in well under a second.
- Files that the initial scan skips are no longer picked up while watching. Changes under directories excluded by `.gitignore` or `.ignore`, such as `node_modules`, are now ignored at runtime too, so they can no longer appear in completions, symbols, or link resolution.

### Changed
- The search index is rebuilt when a search actually needs it, or after a short idle pause, rather than immediately on every document change (previously every keystroke in a large project triggered a full rebuild).

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.16.0...iwes-v0.17.0) - 2026-07-28

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.15.0...iwes-v0.16.0) - 2026-07-26

### Added
- The server now watches the project directory and refreshes its in-memory documents when files change on disk — created, edited, or removed — so edits made by the `iwe` CLI or other tools are picked up without restarting the server.

### Changed
- The server now respects editor ownership of open documents: filesystem changes are applied only to documents that are not open in the editor, and a document is re-read from disk when it is closed (previously the last change won, whether it came from the editor or the disk).

### Fixed
- External file changes are no longer ignored, preventing the server from overwriting on-disk edits with its own stale copy of a document. Previously only file deletions reported by the editor were noticed; creations and edits were dropped.
- A file changed on disk can no longer overwrite unsaved editor edits, and the server's own save can no longer revert a just-typed buffer — changes to open documents are ignored until the document is closed.
- Closing a document without saving now discards its unsaved edits from the server's in-memory state (previously they lingered until the next external change).
- A file renamed on disk by an external tool no longer leaves a stale document under the old name.

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.14.0...iwes-v0.15.0) - 2026-07-22

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.13.0...iwes-v0.14.0) - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- Opening a document with an indented HTML block no longer crashes the server.

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.12.0...iwes-v0.13.0) - 2026-07-15

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.11.0...iwes-v0.12.0) - 2026-07-12

### Added
- `refs_text` markdown option — set to `normalize` to make document formatting rewrite each markdown link's text to the linked document's title; `preserve` (default) keeps the text as written.

### Changed
- Document formatting keeps markdown link text as written by default (previously each link's text was rewritten to the linked document's title on format).

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.10.0...iwes-v0.11.0) - 2026-07-10

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.9.0...iwes-v0.10.0) - 2026-07-09

### Added
- `refs_path` markdown option — `absolute` makes document formatting and link completion write links as root-absolute paths (`/dir/note.md`) instead of paths relative to the linking document.

### Fixed
- Root-absolute links (a leading `/`) and links carrying a `#fragment` now resolve from any directory, so backlinks, go-to-definition, and completions see references that were previously dropped unless the linking file sat at the library root.
- The link code action writes the new link relative to the current document and honors the `refs_path` setting — previously it wrote the target's full library path, producing a broken link when invoked from a document in a subdirectory.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.8.0...iwes-v0.9.0) - 2026-07-09

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.7.0...iwes-v0.8.0) - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- Workspace-symbol search fuses fuzzy matching with BM25 full-text relevance (over document title and body) using Reciprocal Rank Fusion, so a query term in a document's body can lift it above an equally-fuzzy result.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.6.1...iwes-v0.7.0) - 2026-07-03

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.6.0...iwes-v0.6.1) - 2026-07-03

### Fixed

- Renaming a wiki link (`[[target]]` or `[[target|label]]`) now selects the target for editing instead of an empty spot at the closing brackets.
- Positions in a document that starts with an empty frontmatter (`---` / `---`) are no longer shifted up by two lines, so goto-definition, hover, rename, and code actions land on the right line.
- A failed rename (for example when the target file name is already taken) is now returned as a proper LSP error response instead of an empty success, so the editor surfaces the message to the user instead of silently doing nothing.
- Link completion no longer leaves a stray `[` behind when the cursor sits after trailing spaces; the completion is inserted at the cursor instead of overwriting part of an earlier word.
- Find references invoked on a link now reports references to the linked document (rather than the current document) when the request asks to include the declaration.
- An unknown LSP request now returns a `MethodNotFound` error instead of panicking the request handler and leaving the client waiting for a response that never arrives.
- Formatting a document that is not part of the library (a file outside the library path, or a brand-new unsaved file) no longer crashes the server; it returns no edits.
- A transform action environment value that contains non-ASCII characters no longer crashes code action resolution.
- A long editing session on a document that contains a table no longer grows the server's memory without bound; the table's lines are released each time the document is re-parsed.

### Removed

- The advertised `workspace/executeCommand` capability, which offered an unimplemented `generate` command that had no handler.

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.5.0...iwes-v0.6.0) - 2026-06-27

### Added
- `preserve_newlines` config option keeps each line of a paragraph on its own line when formatting instead of joining them with spaces, so documents written with one sentence per line (semantic line breaks) survive format-on-save (default off).

### Fixed
- Formatting a djot document no longer collapses nested or multi-paragraph list items into the parent item; the blank line separating them is kept so the list structure survives format-on-save.
- The server no longer crashes when parsing a djot document that contains a reference link definition or a definition list.
- Formatting keeps the word boundary at a hard line break instead of running the surrounding words together.
- Formatting preserves djot task list checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), display math (`$$`), and autolinks (`<url>`) instead of mangling them.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.4.0...iwes-v0.5.0) - 2026-06-23

### Added
- `format = "djot"` in the configuration makes the server read, format, and write [djot](https://djot.net/) documents and map file URIs using the `.dj` extension (default remains `markdown` with `.md`).

### Fixed
- The server no longer leaks memory as documents are edited and saved; each update used to retain the previous version's graph data, growing memory without bound over a long session.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.3.2...iwes-v0.4.0) - 2026-06-22

### Fixed

- Documents with Windows line endings are no longer stripped of their frontmatter when edited or saved, and code action ranges no longer drift one column per line on such documents.
- Renaming a link target in a document inside a subfolder no longer deletes the target file and replaces it with an empty one; the new file is written to the correct folder with the original content, and backlinks are updated to a valid path.
- Formatting and code actions no longer turn escaped literal text into live Markdown; an escaped `\*text\*`, `\#`, or `\[label\](url)` keeps its escapes, and a list item written as `\[ \]` is no longer rewritten into a task checkbox.

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.3.1...iwes-v0.3.2) - 2026-06-05

### Fixed
- Editing a large document no longer pins the server at 100% CPU; each `textDocument/didChange` reparses the document, and the parser's offset-to-position mapping is no longer quadratic.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.3.0...iwes-v0.3.1) - 2026-06-03

### Fixed
- File URLs are now emitted with a lowercased Windows drive letter (`C:` becomes `c:`) so URIs returned by the server match the casing editors use; drive-letter normalization previously had no effect on Windows.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.2.0...iwes-v0.3.0) - 2026-06-02

### Added
- `markdown.wiki_link_path` config option (`preserve` | `full` | `short`, default `preserve`) controls how completion, the create-link code action, and normalize-on-format write the path inside a wiki link: `preserve` keeps each link as typed, `full` emits the full key path (`[[folder/target]]`), and `short` emits the shortest unambiguous suffix. Completion and create-link, which have no original link to preserve, emit the full key path under `preserve`.

### Changed

- Normalize-on-format now recognizes task-list markers in list items (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`) and normalizes `[X]` to lowercase `[x]`

### Fixed
- Wiki link shortening no longer rewrites a link whose target is missing from the workspace onto an unrelated document that happens to share the file name; such links keep their full path.
## [0.2.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.10...iwes-v0.2.0) - 2026-06-02

### Added
- `markdown.formatting.ordered_list_content_indent` and `markdown.formatting.bullet_list_content_indent` config options control the minimum indentation of list item content in normalize-on-format output (accepts `2`–`4`); set either to `4` for MkDocs-style alignment (`1.  item` / `-   item` with 4-space continuation)

### Fixed
- Hover, go-to-definition, and find-references for wiki links (`[[name]]`) now resolve the target by basename anywhere in the workspace rather than relative to the current file's folder, so a wiki link in a nested folder finds its target in another folder.

### Changed
- Completion and the create-link code action now insert wiki links in their shortest unambiguous form (e.g. `[[target]]` instead of `[[folder/target]]`), and normalize-on-format rewrites existing wiki links to that form.

## [0.1.10](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.9...iwes-v0.1.10) - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- `textDocument/definition`, `textDocument/hover`, and `textDocument/rename` now recognize links inside table cells; navigating from a `[[wiki]]` or `[text](link)` reference in a table previously returned an empty result.
- `textDocument/foldingRange` includes the final line of a multi-line block (such as a table) at the end of a document without a trailing newline, and a two-line blockquote is now foldable.
- `textDocument/hover`, `textDocument/definition`, and `textDocument/rename` now locate links correctly when the line contains emoji or other astral-plane characters; link positions are interpreted as UTF-16 code units per the LSP default (previously a link after an emoji could not be hit because positions were counted as Unicode scalars).

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.8...iwes-v0.1.9) - 2026-05-27

### Fixed

- `textDocument/definition` and `textDocument/hover` now resolve links correctly in documents containing multi-byte characters (previously returned empty results due to byte-vs-character offset mismatch)

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.7...iwes-v0.1.8) - 2026-05-23

### Added

- `textDocument/formatting` honors three new `[markdown.formatting]` options: `wrap_column` wraps paragraphs at the configured column, `preserve_line_breaks` keeps hard line breaks instead of dropping them, and `line_break_style` (`"backslash"` | `"spaces"`, default `"backslash"`) selects how preserved breaks are emitted.

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.6...iwes-v0.1.7) - 2026-05-20

### Added

- `completion.trigger_characters` config option — list of characters advertised to the editor as completion triggers. Defaults to `["["]`.

### Changed

- `textDocument/completion` returns link completions as a `text_edit` whose range covers any leading `[` or `[[` the user typed, so the editor replaces those brackets instead of duplicating them. `[` produces a markdown link, `[[` produces a wiki link regardless of `completion.link_format`; when no bracket precedes the cursor, `completion.link_format` still selects the shape. The range also swallows a trailing `]` (or `]]`) directly after the cursor, so editors with bracket auto-pairing don't leave a stray closing bracket behind.
- `completion.min_prefix_length` default lowered from `3` to `0`, so completions appear as soon as the editor requests them (matching the new `[` trigger). Users who relied on the old behavior should set `min_prefix_length = 3` explicitly.

### Removed

- The hardcoded `+` completion trigger character. Editors that want it can opt in by setting `completion.trigger_characters = ["+"]` (or include it alongside other triggers).

## [0.1.6](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.5...iwes-v0.1.6) - 2026-05-17

### Fixed

- `custom.link` code action and `textDocument/completion` no longer panic on lines containing multi-byte UTF-8 characters; LSP `Position.character` values are interpreted as UTF-16 code units per the LSP spec and converted to byte offsets before slicing the line

## [0.1.5](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.4...iwes-v0.1.5) - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- LSP-driven document writes preserve links to non-markdown files (e.g. `.pdf`, `.html`) instead of appending the configured `refs_extension`

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.3...iwes-v0.1.4) - 2026-05-15

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.2...iwes-v0.1.3) - 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- `textDocument/rename` no longer panics when invoked on a link whose target key is missing from the graph (broken link); the request now returns no edit.

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.1...iwes-v0.1.2) - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- Filter expressions in routed query operations accept the natural form `{type: tracker, $or: [...]}` — bare field keys may be mixed with `$and`/`$or`/`$nor`/`$key`/graph operators at document-matching positions, combining via implicit AND (previously rejected).

### Removed

- Top-level `$not` in routed query filters. `$not` is now field-level only (matching MongoDB); use `$nor: [filter]` for document-level negation. Top-level `$not` returns a parse-time error pointing to `$nor`.

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.1.0...iwes-v0.1.1) - 2026-05-03

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.0.61](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwes-v0.0.60...iwes-v0.0.61) - 2026-03-16

### Other

- CI build fix

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Replace LLM API integration with CLI-based transformations

  Transform actions now execute external CLI commands instead of making direct API calls to LLM providers. This change removes the burden of maintaining API client code and eliminates direct external API calls from IWE. Users are likely to already have CLI AI tools pre-configured with API keys and preferences, making integration seamless. Any CLI-based AI tool can be used: `claude`, `aichat`, `llm`, `sgpt`, or custom scripts.

  - Renamed `[models]` config section to `[commands]`
  - Transform actions now use `command` field instead of `model`
  - Transform actions now use `input_template` field instead of `prompt_template`
  - Removed `context` field from transform actions
  - Commands execute via `sh -c` with input piped to stdin
  - Configuration version bumped to 3 (auto-migration from v2)

### Removed

- Removed `reqwest` dependency (no longer needed for HTTP API calls)
- Removed LLM API client code
- Removed `prompt_key_prefix` configuration option
