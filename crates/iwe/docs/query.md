# Query Language

IWE has a YAML-based, MongoDB-style query language for selecting, shaping,
and mutating documents in a workspace by their frontmatter, graph
relationships, and content. It is reachable through the CLI subcommands
`iwe find`, `iwe count`, `iwe update`, and `iwe delete`, plus the read-only
selector flags on `iwe retrieve`, `iwe tree`, and `iwe export`.

Every YAML example below is a complete, valid input: operation documents run
as given, filter documents fit `--filter`, block predicates fit the block
sites described in the Blocks section.

## Operations

| Operation | CLI subcommand | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `find` | `iwe find` | Returns matched documents (subject to projection). |
| `count` | `iwe count` | Returns the integer count of matched documents. |
| `update` | `iwe update` | Mutates frontmatter and blocks on each matched document. |
| `delete` | `iwe delete` | Removes each matched document and cleans up references. |

`update` and `delete` require an explicit filter — passing `{}` on purpose is
the only way to operate on the whole corpus.

## Filter syntax

A filter document is YAML. A document matches when every top-level key
matches; multiple top-level keys are AND-composed.

### Bare equality

```yaml
status: draft
tags: rust
```

Matches documents whose `status` equals `draft`. For arrays, a bare scalar
tests membership: `tags: rust` matches when `rust` is in the `tags` array.
Cross-type comparisons are always false (no implicit coercion: `priority: "3"`
does not match an integer field).

### Operator expressions

A mapping with `$`-prefixed keys is an operator expression. Operators in one
expression are ANDed together:

```yaml
priority: { $gt: 3 }
score:    { $gte: 3, $lte: 7 }        # closed range [3, 7]
status:   { $in: [draft, review] }
stage:    { $nin: [archived, deleted] }
reviewed: { $exists: true }
tags:     { $all: [rust, async] }
labels:   { $size: 0 }                # exact array length
topics:   { $size: { $gte: 3 } }      # $size also takes count comparisons
```

User frontmatter fields cannot start with `$`, so an operator and a field
name never collide.

### Logical composition

```yaml
$and:
  - status: draft
  - priority: { $gt: 3 }
$or:
  - type: note
  - type: journal
$nor:
  - stage: archived
  - stage: deleted
```

Top-level AND is implicit. Use explicit `$and` when you need the same field
name on multiple sub-clauses (a YAML mapping cannot have duplicate keys).

### Nested fields

Nested fields can be addressed via nested mapping or dotted shorthand; the
two forms are equivalent:

```yaml
author.name: alice
review:
  status: done
```

Field names that themselves contain a literal `.` are not addressable — the
engine always splits paths on `.`.

## Graph operators

Graph operators live alongside frontmatter predicates inside the same filter.
They walk inclusion edges (block-reference inclusion links) or reference
edges (inline links).

### `$key` — identity

```yaml
$key: notes/foo
# $key: { $in: [a, b, c] }                       # any of these
# $key: { $nin: [drafts/scratch, drafts/temp] }  # none of these
```

### `$standing` — computed dialectical standing

```yaml
$standing: undecided
# $standing: { $in: [out, undecided] }   # any of these
# $standing: { $ne: in }                 # anything argued that is not in
```

The standing `iwe argue` computes — `in`, `out` or `undecided` — for the
claim types and objections (see `iwe docs argue`). It is a property of the
whole argument, so it is computed over the whole store whatever the scope of
the filter. Documents that are not argued (concepts, observations, rulings,
disputes, …) never match a `$standing` clause, whichever operator is used.
Usable wherever a filter is: `find`, `argue --filter`, schema `links` and
`requires` rules, and `[invariants]`.

### Relational operators

| Operator | Reads as | Edge type | Walk parameters |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$includes` | this doc includes an anchor | inclusion | `maxDepth`, `minDepth` |
| `$includedBy` | this doc is included by an anchor | inclusion | `maxDepth`, `minDepth` |
| `$references` | this doc references an anchor | reference | `maxDistance`, `minDistance` |
| `$referencedBy` | this doc is referenced by an anchor | reference | `maxDistance`, `minDistance` |

Each takes either a scalar key (shorthand for direct edges) or a mapping with
an optional `match`, walk parameters, and an optional `$size`:

```yaml
# Direct edges only — scalar shorthand for { match: { $key: projects/alpha } }
$includedBy: projects/alpha
```

```yaml
# Walk inclusion edges from a single anchor, bounded
$includedBy: { match: { $key: projects/alpha }, maxDepth: 5 }
```

```yaml
# Anchor by frontmatter predicate (every active project)
$includedBy:
  match:
    type: project
    status: active
  maxDepth: 5
```

```yaml
# Range bounds — documents 2 to 3 hops from archive/index
$referencedBy: { match: { $key: archive/index }, minDistance: 2, maxDistance: 3 }
```

In the full mapping form, **omitting `maxDepth` / `maxDistance` means direct
edges** (depth 1). Set `maxDepth: 0` / `maxDistance: 0` for an unbounded walk
that reaches every transitively-related document. Walks are BFS and
de-duplicate via a visited set, so cycles terminate.

```yaml
$includedBy: { match: { $key: projects/alpha }, maxDepth: 0 }  # whole tree
```

`match` is optional and defaults to `{}` (any document); the empty mapping
`$includedBy: {}` is still a parse error.

#### Scoping edges — `via`

By default every link in a document is a reference edge. `via` narrows the
reference operators to the links found inside the blocks a block predicate
(§Blocks) selects — and it applies afresh at every hop of a transitive
walk, so a chain is only as long as the documents that keep their links in
that scope. A string is shorthand for `{ $within: { $section: NAME } }`.

```yaml
# Documents whose "Is a" section links straight to concepts/entity
$references: { match: { $key: concepts/entity }, via: Is a }
```

```yaml
# The whole genus chain: every document that reaches entity by "Is a" links
# alone, however many hops — a prose mention of entity does not count
$references: { match: { $key: concepts/entity }, via: Is a, maxDistance: 0 }
```

```yaml
# The species of a concept — the documents whose "Is a" names it
$references: { match: { $key: concepts/object }, via: Is a }
```

```yaml
# A concept's own genus chain, read from the other side: everything it
# reaches by "Is a" links, however many hops
$referencedBy: { match: { $key: concepts/system }, via: Is a, maxDistance: 0 }
```

```yaml
# Any block predicate works as the scope
$references: { match: { type: concept }, via: { $within: { $section: Is a }, $item: {} } }
```

`via` combines with `$size` (the count is over scoped links only) and with
`minDistance`/`maxDistance`. It is a reference-walk parameter: on
`$includes`/`$includedBy` it is rejected at parse time.

A relational operator never matches a document in its own anchor set. To
include the anchor, OR it in:

```yaml
$or:
  - $key: projects/alpha
  - $includedBy: { match: { $key: projects/alpha }, maxDepth: 0 }
```

#### Cardinality — `$size`

By default a relational operator holds when at least one document stands in
the relation. Add `$size` to test the *count* of related documents instead.
`$size` takes a non-negative integer (an `$eq` shorthand) or a mapping of
count comparisons (`$eq`, `$ne`, `$gt`, `$gte`, `$lt`, `$lte`); multiple
comparisons AND together. The count is over the distinct documents in the
walk's `[min, max]` band, matching `match`, always excluding the document
itself.

```yaml
$includedBy:   { $size: 0 }              # roots — nothing includes them
$referencedBy: { $size: { $gte: 5 } }    # hubs — 5+ direct referrers
```

```yaml
$includes: { $size: 0 }                  # leaves — include nothing
```

```yaml
$includedBy: { match: { type: project, status: active },
               $size: { $gte: 2 }, maxDepth: 3 }
```

Because the default bounds count direct edges, `$size: 0` is the same whether
bounded or unbounded: zero direct edges means zero at every depth.

### `$content` — content membership

`$content` lifts a block predicate (see Blocks below) into the filter: it
matches documents containing **at least one** block satisfying the predicate.
`$content: {}` matches any document with at least one block.

```yaml
# Drafts, or documents whose content mentions TODO
filter:
  $or:
    - status: draft
    - $content: { $text: "TODO" }
```

```yaml
# Documents under a project that LACK a Status section — absence is
# a quantifier over the whole block set, expressible only in filter
filter:
  $includedBy: { match: { $key: projects/alpha }, maxDepth: 3 }
  $nor:
    - $content: { $header: Status }
```

Like `$key`, it is a noun operator testing the document itself, so it
composes with every other filter clause under `$and` / `$or` / `$nor` and
inside the `match` of any relational operator. `$content` decides membership
only — it selects nothing; which blocks an operation reads or mutates is
designated at the projection or update site.

## Search (`find` only)

`search` is a top-level clause of a `find` operation, beside `filter`. It
selects documents by relevance to a full-text query and supplies the default
ordering. Search leads, filter refines:

```yaml
search:
  lexical: "broken links cleanup"
filter: { type: note }
limit: 5
```

- `lexical: <string>` — BM25 full-text over title + body. `fuzzy: <string>`
  — skim subsequence match over title + key. Both present → RRF fusion,
  exactly as `iwe find --fuzzy --lexical`. At least one is required;
  `search: {}` is a parse-time error, as is any key other than `lexical` /
  `fuzzy`.
- **Search selects and orders.** A document is in the result iff it matches
  the search **and** passes the `filter`, ordered by relevance, ties by key
  ascending. Candidates with no BM25 hit / no skim score are dropped — a
  text query is a filter here, not a sort variant. `limit: 5` always means
  the 5 best documents that pass the filter.
- **`search` + `sort` is legal.** Search contributes membership and the
  default ordering; an explicit `sort` overrides the ordering only. "The 5
  newest documents matching Q" is `search` + `sort: { modified_at: -1 }` +
  `limit: 5`.
- **Corpus-global scores.** The BM25 index is fit to the whole workspace;
  IDF is not re-fit per filter.
- A `lexical` query that stems away to nothing (stop words only) matches
  nothing; the result carries a structured warning so callers see why it is
  empty.
- `search` is `find` only — not `count` / `update` / `delete`.

## Projection (`find` only)

`project` shapes each result to exactly the listed fields; `addFields` keeps
the default fields and adds to them. The two are mutually exclusive. Each
entry maps an output name to a source: `1`, `true`, and YAML null project the
frontmatter field of the same name, a dotted path projects a nested
frontmatter field, and a `$`-selector projects a system field.

```yaml
project:
  title: 1
  priority: meta.priority
  key: $key
  body: $content
  parents: $includedBy
```

The `$`-selectors: `$key`, `$title`, `$titleSlug`, `$content`,
`$frontmatter`, `$includes`, `$includedBy`, `$references`, `$referencedBy`.

Projection can also address blocks inside each matched document — narrowed
bodies, located blocks, grep lines. See Block projection below.

## Sort and limit

```yaml
sort:  { modified_at: -1 }   # 1 = ascending, -1 = descending
limit: 100                   # 0 = no limit
```

Exactly one sort key is accepted. Ties (and the no-sort case) are broken by
document key in ascending lexicographic order.

## Update operators

```yaml
filter: { type: note }
update:
  $set:
    reviewed: true
    audited_at: 2026-04-26
    "review.reviewer": alice
  $unset:
    draft_notes: ""
```

`$set` adds the field if absent, replaces it otherwise. Mapping values
replace wholesale; use dotted shorthand to write subset leaves without
dropping siblings. `$unset` removes fields; values are ignored.

Block update operators — `$replace`, `$replaceText`, `$insertBefore`,
`$insertAfter`, `$append`, `$delete` — live in the same `update` document as
siblings of `$set` / `$unset` and combine freely with them. See Block update
operators below.

### Field names the language cannot address

The engine preserves every frontmatter field a document carries, whatever
its name starts with. One name shape cannot be addressed: `$`-prefixed names
are the operator vocabulary, so a path segment beginning with `$` — in a
filter key, a sort key, a projection source, or a `$set` / `$unset` target,
at any depth — is a parse-time error. Such a field is still stored, returned
and validated; it just cannot be reached by a path.

## Blocks

The language also addresses **blocks** — the structural nodes inside a
document: headers, paragraphs, lists, list items, code blocks, quotes,
tables, references, horizontal rules. There is no separate block-selection
clause; blocks enter through three sites the operation document already
owns:

| Site | Addition | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `filter` | `$content` operator | Document membership by content |
| `project` / `addFields` | `{ $content: P }` narrowing, `$blocks` and `$matches` sources | Read a slice of a document: narrowed body, located blocks, grep lines |
| `update` | Block operators, each carrying its own selection | Mutate blocks |

One grammar — the **block predicate** — is consumed at all three sites, and
one convention governs every argument shape: **`$`-prefixed keys select,
bare keys configure.** Inside an update operator's argument, the `$`-keys
form the block predicate and the bare keys (`from`, `to`, `content`,
`expect`) are the payload.

Membership stays `filter`'s alone: nothing outside `filter` adds or removes
documents from the result. Deliberately out of scope: computed replacements
(renumbering, case transforms), stateful walks, inline-element rewriting —
the driving agent reads the selection, computes, and applies literal edits.
The typical workflow is two operations sharing one predicate: locate with
`project: { hits: { $blocks: P } }`, then mutate with an update operator
carrying the same `P`.

### Block model

Each block type has its own predicate operator. **Node** operators select the
matching block alone; **tree** operators select the block together with
everything below it. The **own text** column is what text predicates match
against:

| Operator | Sort | Markdown construct | Own text |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `$header` | node | heading (`#`, `##`, …); the blocks of its section are its children | the heading text |
| `$paragraph` | node | paragraph | the paragraph text |
| `$list` | tree | bullet or ordered list — an empty head whose children are the items | none |
| `$quote` | tree | block quote — an empty head wrapping the quoted blocks | none |
| `$item` | node | list item | the item's own line — a loose item's leading paragraph folds into it — excluding nested children |
| `$code` | node | fenced code block | the code text, excluding the fence lines |
| `$table` | node | table | the rows as rendered, one line per row |
| `$ref` | node | block reference (inclusion link) | the authored (piped wikilink) text, when present |
| `$hr` | node | horizontal rule | none |

The tree rooted at a header — the header together with every block below it —
is a **section**: `$header` matches the heading line alone, `$section`
selects the whole tree. Quotes and lists are containers with **empty heads**:
the root carries no own text, so their operators select the container with
its contents, and `$within` peels the wrapper off. A **container** is a block
that can carry children — a header, an item, a list, a quote; containers are
the legal `$append` targets. Raw HTML blocks are outside the model — the
parser drops them.

**Own text.** Text predicates evaluate against a block's own text only,
never descendant text. A header whose section contains `TODO` does not match
`$text: TODO` — the paragraph carrying it does. To select a block *because
of* its contents, use `$contains`. Own texts are pairwise disjoint, which
the update semantics rely on.

**Normalized form.** Matching operates on the normalized rendering of the
document — the same form `iwe retrieve` and every other read emits — at the
byte level: inline markup keeps its markdown syntax (`**bold**` stays
`**bold**`, never `bold`), and inline link URLs are part of own text,
rendered relative to the containing document. Text copied from a read
matches byte-for-byte in a later predicate or `$replaceText` anchor. In
normalized form every block's own text is a single line, except code blocks
and tables — one line per code line or table row, with table cells padded to
their column width.

**Section path.** Every block has a section path: the titles of its
enclosing sections, ordered from the document root down, with top-level
headers omitted — the value block reads emit as `path`. Path elements are
plain text (inline markup stripped); a heading's own text keeps its markdown
syntax — echo own text, not path elements, into text predicates.

**No block identity.** No IDs are minted or written to files; addressing is
by predicate against normalized text, guarded by `expect`. Two byte-identical
sibling blocks under the same section path are indistinguishable — every
mutation touches both or fails its `expect`. The escape hatch is the
whole-body rewrite (`iwe update -k KEY -c CONTENT`).

**Readable but not editable.** The task-checkbox marker (`[ ]` / `[x]`) sits
outside an item's own text: text predicates never see it, no predicate
selects items by state, and `$replaceText` cannot toggle it. Tables select,
render, and travel as units — membership, reads, `$delete`, `$replace`, and
the insertion anchors all work — but `$replaceText` selecting a table is a
validation error; editing inside a table means replacing the table.

### Block predicates

A block predicate is a YAML mapping of `$`-prefixed operators. The empty
predicate `{}` matches every block; top-level keys AND together; unknown
`$`-names and bare keys are parse-time errors.

| Operator | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `$text: S` | own text contains `S`, case-insensitively; `$text: { $eq: S }` matches the whole own text, also case-insensitively |
| `$matches: REGEX` | own text matches the pattern (Rust regex, case-sensitive — use an inline `(?i)` flag; no backreferences or lookaround) |
| `$header`, `$paragraph`, `$item`, `$code`, `$table` | blocks of one type — the matching block alone, no implicit subtree; the argument is a nested predicate, and a scalar is exact-text shorthand (`$header: Status`) |
| `$ref` | block references, selected by target (`$ref: { $references: KEY }`); the scalar shorthand is a parse-time error, and text predicates match the authored (piped) link text alone |
| `$hr` | horizontal rules; no own text — the scalar shorthand and direct text predicates in the argument are parse-time errors |
| `$section: T` | a header matching `T` together with everything below it; scalar `T` is exact-text shorthand for the root header |
| `$quote: P`, `$list: P` | a quote / a list together with its contents; the root has no own text, so scalars and direct text predicates in the argument are parse-time errors — scope with `$within` or `$contains` |
| `$within: T` | blocks inside the selection — a section's body, a quote's content, at any depth; scalar `T` names a section; a mapping argument must select content: `{}`, or a predicate containing `$section` / `$quote` / `$list` |
| `$contains: P` | blocks with a descendant matching `P`, at any depth |
| `$references: KEY` | blocks whose own content links to `KEY` — a ref targeting `KEY`, or inline text linking to it |
| `$and`, `$or`, `$nor` | logical composition, as in filters |

```yaml
$header: {}                                     # every header: the outline
```

```yaml
$section: Unreleased                            # one section, header included
```

```yaml
$within: Goals                                  # inside Goals, header excluded
```

```yaml
$within: { $section: { $matches: "^Q[0-9]" } }  # inside any quarterly section
```

```yaml
$paragraph: { $references: archive/old-plan }   # paragraphs linking to a document
```

```yaml
{ $header: {}, $contains: { $matches: "(?i)todo" } }  # headers whose section holds a TODO
```

```yaml
$within: { $quote: {} }                         # quoted content, wrapper peeled off
```

Deeper scoping is recursion, not extra syntax — each element of a section
path becomes one `$section` predicate scoped by `$within` to the elements
before it:

```yaml
# Inside Q3, itself inside Goals (matches Goals > 2026 > Q3, not Q3 > Goals)
$within: { $section: { $text: { $eq: Q3 }, $within: Goals } }
```

Conditions inside a type operator's argument and conditions beside it
conjoin identically: `{ $header: { $matches: "^Q" } }` and
`{ $header: {}, $matches: "^Q" }` match the same blocks. Type follows the
block model, not the visual layout — a loose item's leading paragraph folds
into the item, so its text matches `$item`, not `$paragraph`. When unsure of
a block's type, locate with an untyped predicate (`$blocks: { $text: alpha }`)
and read the entry's `type`.

`$within: {}` is the interior of the document itself — every block below the
top level; a top-level block is therefore `$nor: [{ $within: {} }]`.

#### Selection semantics

A block predicate is evaluated against every block in the document, at every
depth, always. Node operators select each matching block alone; tree
operators (`$section`, `$quote`, `$list`) select the matching root together
with every block below it. The result is a **forest**: the selected blocks
arranged by ancestry, in document order. Union over multiple matches is
automatic: when a selector matches several headers, `$within` is the union
of all their interiors.

For sections, three selections line up on one predicate:

| Selection | Predicate | Denotes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| the header alone | `$header: Goals` | one node — the heading line |
| the section — header and contents | `$section: Goals` | the full tree |
| the contents only | `$within: Goals` | the tree minus its root |

Each consumer takes from the forest what it needs: membership (`$content` in
filter) tests that it is non-empty; `$content` in projection renders it;
`$blocks` flattens it to data; the unit update operators act on its roots;
`$within` drops them.

### Block projection

Three projection sources consume a block predicate. Each takes the predicate
in an options mapping; the bare form is the empty-predicate shorthand.

| Source | Projects |
| --- | --- |
| `{ $content: P }` | the document body narrowed to the selected blocks, rendered at their original depth — a string |
| `$blocks` / `{ $blocks: P }` | one entry per selected block: `type`, `path` (enclosing section titles), `text` (own text) |
| `{ $matches: REGEX }` | grep — one entry per matching line: `path` plus the full line as `text` |

```yaml
project:
  key: $key
  toc: { $content: { $header: {} } }                  # headers-only rendering
  notes: { $content: { $section: Unreleased } }       # one section, as it appears
  hits: { $blocks: { $within: Goals, $text: "Q3" } }  # located blocks as data
  found: { $matches: "(?i)todo|fixme" }               # grep lines
```

Bare `$content` is `{ $content: {} }` — every block, the full body. A
matched document in which no block matches projects `""`. Multiple narrowed
entries may coexist in one projection, each with its own predicate.

**`$content` narrowing** renders each selected block's own content in
document order, at its original depth, normalized. Nothing renders that was
not selected; subtrees appear when the predicate selects them (`$section`,
`$within`), never by implication.

**`$blocks`** entries carry `type` (the operator name without the `$`),
`path`, and `text` (the own text). A header's entry carries its heading
text, not its section — use `$content` narrowing to read bodies. Every entry
carries `text` — `""` for blocks without own text; a ref entry additionally
carries `target`. The entry count is the number `$replaceText`'s `expect`
pins; a tree selection lists every block of its trees flattened, so it
over-counts unit-operator targets — list those by selecting the roots as
nodes (a `$section: P` previews as `$header: P`).

**`$matches`** applies the pattern to the own text of every block in scope
and reports one entry per matching line, in document order — the full line,
not the matched substring, and never the whole block. The argument is a
regex scalar, or a mapping combining the pattern with a scope — bare
`pattern` is the payload, `$`-keys select:

```yaml
project:
  found: { $matches: { pattern: "(?i)todo", $within: Goals } }
```

#### Top-level form

`project` (not `addFields`) also accepts a block predicate directly in place
of the field map — any `$`-key at the top level selects this reading, and
the result carries the document's `key` plus a `content` field with the
narrowed body:

```yaml
project: { $header: {} }        # the headers-only form of each document
```

```yaml
# exactly the same as
project:
  key: $key
  content: { $content: { $header: {} } }
```

Top-level keys conjoin as in any block predicate —
`project: { $header: {}, $within: Usage }` is the table of contents of one
section. Mixing bare and `$`-keys is a parse-time error, `project: {}` keeps
its meaning of an explicit empty projection, and the projection sources are
not predicate operators — `project: { $blocks: P }` is an unknown-operator
error, and a top-level `$matches` reads as the block-predicate operator,
never the grep source.

### Block update operators

Block operators live directly in the `update` document, as siblings of
`$set` and `$unset`. Every update operator is an *(address, payload)* pair:
`$set` addresses by field path, the block operators address by block
predicate. An operator's argument is one flat mapping — the `$`-keys form
the predicate, the bare keys are the payload and the optional `expect`
guard. The bare-key set per operator is closed; unknown bare keys are
parse-time errors. Each operator appears at most once per update document;
applying one operator to several independent selections requires several
operations.

| Operator | Payload | Effect per target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$replace` | `content` (markdown) | Replace the target as selected — a tree target wholesale, a node target as its own line(s); on a header node, a heading payload retitles the section |
| `$replaceText` | `from` (optional), `to` | With `from`: replace that substring of the block's own text with `to`. Without `from`: `to` replaces the entire own text |
| `$insertBefore` | `content` (markdown) | Insert sibling content before the target |
| `$insertAfter` | `content` (markdown) | Insert sibling content after the target — after a header node: directly below the heading line; after a `$section`: below the whole tree |
| `$append` | `content` (markdown) | Append child content at the end of the block (containers only — a header: at the end of its section; an item: after its nested blocks; a list: after its last item; a quote: after its last block) |
| `$delete` | — | Remove the target as selected — a `$section` with its contents; a bare `$header` dissolves into its enclosing section |

```yaml
filter:
  $content: { $text: "Q3" }
update:
  $set: { reviewed: true }
  $replaceText:
    $within: Goals
    $text: "Q3 Milestones"
    from: "Q3 Milestones"
    to: "Q3 2026 Milestones"
    expect: 1
  $delete:
    $paragraph: { $references: archive/old-plan }
```

An argument with no `$`-keys carries the empty predicate and selects **all
blocks**: `$delete: {}` clears the document body — title header included —
bounded by the required `filter` and guardable with `expect`.

#### Targets and coalescing

The unit operators (`$replace`, `$insertBefore`, `$insertAfter`, `$append`,
`$delete`) act on **targets**: the selection's forest roots, each taken *as
selected* — a tree root (`$section`, `$quote`, `$list`) is the whole tree, a
node root is the block alone, never its children. This is the same rule
projection follows: `$content: { $header: Goals }` renders one heading line,
and `$delete: { $header: Goals }` removes one heading line — the predicate
means the same thing at every site.

Targets **coalesce by extent**: a target lying inside another target's
extent is absorbed by the outer one — selecting a section and a paragraph
within it yields one target, the section, so `$delete: { $section: {} }`
deletes each outermost section once. Node targets never absorb one another:
own texts are pairwise disjoint, so two node targets always name disjoint
lines. Operators apply once per target, in document order.

Insertions are **anchored**: inserted content stays adjacent to its target,
so when `$insertAfter` on a block and `$insertBefore` on its following
sibling name the same gap, each lands hugging its anchor.

**`$replaceText`** operates on own text and applies to **every selected
block, un-coalesced**. A selected header's `$replaceText` edits the heading
text and nothing below it; a selected ref's edits its authored link text,
and the target key never changes. `from` is optional. When present it must
occur **exactly once** in each selected block's own text, matched
**byte-exact** against the normalized form — case-sensitive, unlike `$text`;
the workflow is to echo text read from `$blocks` output. When omitted, `to`
replaces the block's **entire own text** — renaming a header is
`{ $header: Goals, to: Aims }`; pair the `from`-less form with a
text-bearing predicate or an `expect` guard. A selected block with no own
text (a quote or list root, a horizontal rule, a ref without authored text)
or a table is a validation error.

**Payload markdown** (`content`) is parsed and normalized on write. Heading
levels inside a supplied fragment define nesting within the fragment only;
the fragment's root level is set by its attachment point — child of the
target for `$append`, sibling of the target for the insertions, the target's
own position for `$replace`. At a list attachment point — sibling of an
item, child of a list — the fragment must parse as a single list; its items
attach, and the target keeps its own list type.

#### Headers: retitle, dissolve, remove, clear

Every unit edit splices the target's lines in the normalized rendering; the
document re-parses, and normalization re-derives nesting and header levels
from the result. Headers are where the node/tree distinction matters — the
three selections become three different operations:

| Selection | `$delete` | `$replace: { content: C }` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `$header: Goals` — the heading line | **Dissolve**: the heading line is removed; the former contents re-attach to the enclosing section and re-level | C splices at the heading line. A heading payload **retitles** — the former contents re-nest beneath it; any other payload dissolves the section around it |
| `$section: Goals` — header and contents | **Remove**: the header and every block below it | C replaces the whole section |
| `$within: Goals` — contents only | **Clear**: the header stays, its blocks go | C replaces each content target |

Against

```markdown
# Roadmap

## Goals

Ship the editor integration

### Q3 Milestones

Deliver block operations spec
```

`$delete: { $header: Goals }` yields

```markdown
# Roadmap

Ship the editor integration

## Q3 Milestones

Deliver block operations spec
```

— the paragraph re-attaches to `Roadmap`, and `Q3 Milestones` re-levels from
`###` to `##`. Re-leveling ripples through the whole former subtree: after a
header edit, expect level changes below the splice point.
`$replace: { $header: Goals, content: "## Aims" }` retitles — the same
document with `## Aims` in place of `## Goals`, contents intact; the
payload's own level is advisory, since normalization re-levels to the
attachment point. The destructive whole-section forms require naming the
tree: `$delete: { $section: Goals }`.

The asymmetry of mistakes is deliberate: deleting a header node when the
section was meant leaves visible, recoverable content behind; the reverse
mistake under subtree semantics would silently destroy a section. The
intuition is the text editor's — deleting a heading line does not delete the
text under it.

`$replace` is per-target, never "set the body to C": against a body with
three top-level blocks, `$replace: { content: X }` yields `X` three times.
Whole-body replacement is the CLI body-overwrite mode; a single-target
`$replace` is guarded with `expect: 1`.

#### Combining operators

`$set`, `$unset`, and block operators combine freely in one update document
and apply atomically per matched document. Block operator applications must
be **pairwise disjoint by extent** after coalescing: no two applications may
touch the same block, or a tree target and anything within it — a `$delete`
taking the Goals *section* while a `$replaceText` edits a paragraph inside
it is a validation error listing the pair, nothing written. A `$delete` of
the Goals *header node* beside the same `$replaceText` is legal: the heading
line and the paragraph are disjoint extents.

Frontmatter operators apply to **every** filter-matched document regardless
of block selections — membership is `filter`'s alone. To restrict a combined
operation to documents where the block edit lands, conjoin `$content` into
the filter with the same predicate:

```yaml
filter:
  status: active
  $content: { $text: "Q3" }
update:
  $set: { reviewed: true }
  $replaceText: { $text: "Q3", from: "Q3", to: "Q3 2026" }
```

Drop the `$content` line and `reviewed` is stamped on every `active`
document while the text edit lands only where `Q3` occurs.

### `expect` guards

Any block operator application may carry `expect: N` or
`expect: { min: M, max: N }` as a bare key, asserting the number of
applications it will make, counted across all mutated documents
(post-`limit`):

- The **unit operators** count **targets** — the coalesced roots: one
  section, however many blocks it holds, is one target, so
  `$delete: { $section: Goals, expect: 1 }` passes.
- **`$replaceText`** counts selected **blocks**, un-coalesced, matching its
  per-block application.

`update` and `delete` operation documents additionally take a
**document-level** `expect` — a top-level clause, sibling of `filter` /
`sort` / `limit` — asserting the number of matched documents the operation
will write. In a `find` or `count` operation a top-level `expect` is a
parse-time error. The two levels are independent quantities.

On violation the whole operation fails before writing anything; the error
reports the actual count plus each target as
`key › section path › first line of own text` (documents as `key › title`).
`expect: 1` is the single-target precision edit; `expect: 0` is legal and
asserts an empty selection.

```yaml
# Bounded cleanup: delete completed task paragraphs, refusing a runaway match
filter: { type: meeting }
update:
  $delete:
    $paragraph: { $matches: "^DONE " }
    expect: { max: 20 }
```

### Validation and atomicity

The operation validates fully before writing anything, anywhere.

**Parse time:** unknown operators; unknown bare keys in an operator
argument; invalid payload types; regex that fails to compile; a `$within`
argument that cannot select content; block operators in a `find` / `count` /
`delete` operation.

**Evaluation time**, against the original normalized documents — every
selection and anchor position is resolved before any edit applies — in
order:

1. **Type compatibility** — `$append` on a non-container block;
   `$replaceText` selecting a block with no own text or a table; a `content`
   payload that cannot attach at its site. The error lists every offending
   block.
2. **`$replaceText` anchors** — a given `from` absent or occurring more than
   once in any selected block's own text.
3. **Disjointness** — block-operator applications with overlapping extents.
   The error lists the pairs.
4. **`expect`** — any violated guard, block-level or document-level.

Any failure aborts the whole operation: frontmatter operators write nothing
if a block operator fails validation, and no document is written if any
document fails. Per document, frontmatter and block edits commit as one
atomic rewrite.

### Strict mode

The `expect` guards are optional in the language; strictness is a property
of the **surface**, not the grammar — the same operation document is valid
everywhere; a strict surface refuses to *run* an unguarded mutation.

- **CLI**: `iwe update` and `iwe delete` take `--strict`. Under the flag,
  every mutating application must carry its guard — the operation's
  document-level `--expect` and each block operator's `expect`. A missing
  guard is an error before anything runs.
- **MCP**: the `iwe_query` tool is always strict, no opt-out.

`--dry-run` writes nothing and is exempt from strict mode — it is how the
counts are learned: dry-run the mutation, read the matched documents, pin
`expect` to what it shows, re-run. An agent that just located its targets
with `$blocks` already knows the counts.

### Locate, then mutate

The agent workflow is two operations sharing one predicate:

```yaml
# 1. Locate (read)
filter:
  $includedBy: { match: { $key: projects/roadmap }, maxDepth: 3 }
  $content: { $within: Goals, $text: "Q3" }
project:
  key: $key
  hits: { $blocks: { $within: Goals, $text: "Q3" } }
```

```yaml
# 2. Mutate (same predicate, now inside the operator)
filter:
  $includedBy: { match: { $key: projects/roadmap }, maxDepth: 3 }
update:
  $replaceText:
    $within: Goals
    $text: "Q3 Milestones"
    from: "Q3 Milestones"
    to: "Q3 2026 Milestones"
    expect: 1
```

## Schema

The language is published as a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) at
<https://iwe.md/schemas/query/draft/2026-08/schema>, and `iwe docs query-schema`
prints the copy embedded in this binary. Every example above is checked
against it, so the schema and the parser cannot drift apart.

The operation kind comes from the subcommand rather than the document, so the
root is a union of the four kinds. Point at a specific definition when the
kind is known: `#/$defs/findOperation`, `#/$defs/countOperation`,
`#/$defs/updateOperation`, `#/$defs/deleteOperation`, `#/$defs/filter` for a
`--filter` argument, `#/$defs/blockPredicate` for a block-operator argument.

In an editor with a YAML language server, name it on the first line:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://iwe.md/schemas/query/draft/2026-08/schema
filter: { type: note }
limit: 10
```

The schema catches every parse-time error except seven the parser keeps to
itself: regex compilation, a `$within` argument that cannot select content,
the three inverted-range checks (`minDepth`/`maxDepth`,
`minDistance`/`maxDistance`, `expect.min`/`expect.max`), `$set` / `$unset`
path conflicts, `-k KEY` combined with a `--filter` carrying `$key`, integers
written with a fraction or an exponent (`limit: 1.0`, `limit: 1e3` — the
same number as `1` to JSON Schema, a parse error here), and the checks that
happen at evaluation time. The schema is stricter in one place: an explicit
YAML null on an optional key (`sort: null`, `match: null`, `lexical: null`),
which the parser reads as the key being absent, and an empty document are
schema errors — write the key or leave it out.

## CLI flags

On the CLI, structural anchor flags lower to graph operators. A
`KEY[:DEPTH]` suffix sets `maxDepth` (or `maxDistance`) for that anchor;
depth `0` is the unbounded sentinel.

| CLI flag | Lowers to |
| --- | --- |
| `-k KEY` | `$key: KEY` (1 key = `$eq`; 2+ = `$in`) |
| `--includes KEY` | `$includes: KEY` (scalar shorthand, depth 1) |
| `--included-by KEY:5` | `$includedBy: { match: { $key: KEY }, maxDepth: 5 }` |
| `--references KEY:0` | `$references: { match: { $key: KEY }, maxDistance: 0 }` (unbounded) |

`via` has no flag of its own — write the operator in `--filter`, which takes the same YAML as a query's `filter`.
| `--referenced-by KEY` | `$referencedBy: KEY` |
| `--max-depth N` | session default for `--includes` / `--included-by` (default 1) |
| `--max-distance N` | session default for `--references` / `--referenced-by` (default 1) |
| `--filter "EXPR"` | inline YAML filter document |
| `--project "EXPR"` | `project: EXPR` — comma list (`title,author`, `body=$content`, bare `$blocks`) or inline YAML mapping (find, tree) |
| `--add-fields "EXPR"` | `addFields: EXPR` — same grammar as `--project`, extends the defaults (find, tree) |
| `--sort field:1` / `--sort field:-1` | `sort: { field: 1 / -1 }` (find only) |
| `-l, --limit N` | `limit: N` (find, count) |
| `--blocks "PRED"` | `addFields: { blocks: { $blocks: PRED } }` (find only) |
| `--matches PATTERN` | `filter: { $content: { $matches: PATTERN } }` **and** `addFields: { matches: { $matches: PATTERN } }` (find only) |
| `--set FIELD=VALUE` | `$set: { FIELD: VALUE }` (update only; repeatable) |
| `--unset FIELD` | `$unset: { FIELD: "" }` (update only; repeatable) |
| `--replace`, `--replace-text`, `--insert-before`, `--insert-after`, `--append`, `--delete` `"ARG"` | one block-operator entry (`$replace`, `$replaceText`, …) in the `update` document (update only) |
| `--expect VAL` | the document-level `expect` clause (update, delete) |
| `--strict` | surface policy, not grammar: requires the `expect` guards on every mutating application (update, delete) |

All filter flags AND together. For OR or NOR, write the composition inside
`--filter`:

```bash
iwe find --filter '$or: [{ status: draft }, { status: review }]'
iwe find --filter '$nor: [{ status: archived }]'
```

`--matches` is a composite flag — it lowers to both a membership clause and
a projection entry, because one-flag grep is the point. Each block-operator
flag's argument is that operator's `{ $selector…, payload… }` mapping — the
operator name is the flag, so the `$replaceText:` wrapper is dropped.

Combining `-k KEY` with a `--filter` whose top level also contains `$key` is
a parse-time error — pick one source, or use `-k a -k b` for multi-key
match.
