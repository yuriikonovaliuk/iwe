# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `asserts` rules in schemas: a document must satisfy a filter over its own fields (`iwe docs schema` §12).
- `iwe argue`: propositions and the contrariety check, strength ordering (attack ≠ defeat), conclusions; `$this.frontmatter.<path>` in schema `links` rules (`iwe docs argue`, `iwe docs schema` §11).
- `iwe argue` knows `axiom` documents, checks that a rebutting or undermining objection's `## Denies` quotes its target, and warns on support cycles (`iwe docs argue`).
- `links` rules accept `when:` (`iwe docs schema` §11); `argue` treats a particular objection against a generic claim as an exception, not a defeat (`iwe docs argue`).
- `iwe argue --explain`: the diagnosis — root cycles behind every undecided node and the moves that break them, downstream claims, defeated claims with reinstatement moves, hypotheses waiting on an observation. `argue` also warns on circular grounds.
- `$standing` in every filter (`find`, `argue --filter`, schema `links`/`requires`, `[invariants]`): select documents by computed dialectical standing (`iwe docs query`, `iwe docs config`).
- `iwe argue [-k KEY]... [--filter F] [-f text|json]`: the dialectical standing of every claim (`iwe docs argue`); always exits 0.
- `requires` (conditional sections) and `$this` anchors in `links` filters are enforced by `iwe schema validate` (`iwe docs schema` §11–12); `[invariants]` from `config.toml` run on every whole-store validation (`iwe docs config`).
- `iwe schema validate` enforces `links` rules from schema files (target typing, link counts, transitive reach along a section's links); the query language gains `via` on the reference operators. Documented in `iwe docs schema` §11 and `iwe docs query`.

## [0.23.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.22.0...iwe-v0.23.0) - 2026-08-30

### Added
- `iwe docs query-schema` prints a JSON Schema (draft 2020-12) for the query language, also published at `https://iwe.md/schemas/query/draft/2026-08/schema` so an editor, an agent or another schema can point at it; it is checked against the parser on every example in `iwe docs query`

### Changed
- `injection` slices are plain queries: each is a `filter` and/or a `sort` with an optional `heading` and `limit`, and session start lists what they select from the store minus `MEMORY` and `queries` (previously every slice was ANDed with `knowledge_filter`, and `recent: true` / `changed: true` were separate sources)
- `iwe internal claude session brief` prints what session start lists (previously the knowledge filter and a recent section ordered by `recency_field`)
- `iwe internal claude enable` no longer stamps `created` on `MEMORY.md`, and writes an explicit `injection` slice into the frontmatter for the user to edit
- `MEMORY.md` distill knobs are one nested group: `distill.max_chunk_size` (default 25000, was `chunk_chars` at 10000), `distill.max_proposals` (was `max_proposals_per_read`) and `distill.remind_after_days` (was `remind_every_days`; `-1` now disables the reminder and `0` reminds every session, previously `0` disabled it); their `IWE_DISTILL_*` environment twins follow the path, and `iwe internal claude policy` names a legacy key it finds with its new path
- Each `injection` slice may set its own `max_tokens`; a slice with neither `limit` nor `max_tokens` lists everything it matches

### Removed
- `knowledge_filter` and `recency_field` knobs and their `IWE_*` environment twins, the `recent` and `changed` slice sources, and the `session complete` warning about a document outside the knowledge filter
- Session start no longer runs `git status`; nothing in memory assumes the store is in a git repository
- `injection_max_tokens` knob and `IWE_INJECTION_MAX_TOKENS` — the budget is per slice

## [0.22.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.21.0...iwe-v0.22.0) - 2026-08-29

### Changed
- `find`, `update`, `create --set` and `schema` treat frontmatter fields starting with `_`, `#` or `@` as ordinary fields and never drop them (previously hidden from output and stripped on `update`); `$`-named fields are kept and validated but cannot be targeted by `--filter`, `--sort`, `--project`, `--set` or `--unset`

## [0.21.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.20.1...iwe-v0.21.0) - 2026-08-29

### Added
- `iwe normalize -k <key>` normalizes only the named documents, leaves their frontmatter as written and prints only the paths that changed
- `knowledge_filter`, `recency_field`, `injection`, `max_proposals_per_read` and `remind_every_days` knobs on `MEMORY.md`
- Switching memory on installs a default `.iwe/schemas/memory.yaml` that constrains only the `created` and `session` fields
- A document written with the Write or Edit tool is normalized, checked against the schemas that bind it, and reported when it closely matches one the store already has
- A captured document under an area directory is linked into that area's hub when one exists
- Session start reports how many sessions are undistilled and, at most once per `remind_every_days`, offers to read them

### Changed
- `update` block operators (`--append`, `--replace`, `--delete`, …) given an argument that is not a YAML mapping now report the flag, the mapping shape it takes and an example (previously the raw parser error)
- Memory's own state lives under `.iwe/claude/`, outside the graph (previously `sessions/<id>` documents in the store). The default `knowledge_filter` is `{ $key: { $nin: [MEMORY, queries] } }` (was `{ distilled_lines: { $exists: false }, $key: { $nin: [MEMORY, queries] } }`)
- The `init`, `distill` and `reflect` prompts carry procedure only; the shape of a memory document is the `MEMORY.md` policy's alone, read by section name (`## How to write it`, `## Dedup and updates`, `## Curation`)
- `/iwe:distill` asks about every candidate before anything is written — `Keep all` / `Skip all` / `Let me pick`, then one candidate at a time for a handful, or a numbered list with batched multi-select questions for more — and reads a backlog with one reader per session, so a fact several sessions raised is asked about once (previously it walked the backlog session by session and re-proposed what recurred)
- Reading a session can now run unattended; selection never does
- `/iwe:init` sets memory up and hands the sessions on disk to `/iwe:distill`; it reads none of them itself
- The session-start block's closing lines come from the policy's `## At session start` section (previously hard-coded)
- `iwe create` and `iwe update --content` normalize the body on the way in, leaving the frontmatter as written

### Removed
- Automatic capture: nothing reads a transcript on its own any more, and the chunks it kept under `.iwe/claude-sessions/` are gone
- The `sweep_threshold_lines`, `max_chunks_per_sweep`, `max_items_per_chunk` and `inflight_ttl_minutes` knobs; a policy that still sets one is ignored

## [0.20.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.20.0...iwe-v0.20.1) - 2026-08-24

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.20.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.19.1...iwe-v0.20.0) - 2026-08-23

### Added
- `iwe internal` — hidden commands backing the Claude Code memory integration: enabling memory, session hooks, transcript digests, and the capture queue an agent works through
- Capture chunks — the raw transcript digests the memory queue serves — live under `.iwe/claude-sessions/` at the workspace root (or `$IWE_MEMORY_STATE`), ignored by git and outside the graph; only the `MEMORY.md` policy and the `sessions/<id>` records are store documents
- `iwe init` offers to enable Claude memory when a `.claude/` directory is present, defaulting to no
- `iwe delete -k <key>` — the same key flag `retrieve` and `update` take, alongside the existing positional
- `iwe internal claude prompt <init|distill|reflect|distill-agent>` prints the instructions the memory plugin's skills and agent follow, so the plugin ships only frontmatter and the text always matches the installed binary
- `iwe docs agent` — the policy an agent follows to use this CLI, served by the binary so the published skill never lags the release

### Changed
- `iwe init` asks a separate question before adding the `AGENTS.md` section and registering the `.mcp.json` server, defaulting to no (previously confirming the detected settings wrote both files)
- The `AGENTS.md` section `iwe init` writes explains the graph principles and points at `iwe help` and `iwe docs` (previously it listed specific commands and detected store conventions)
- `schema validate` warns on stderr when its bindings match no documents (previously a silent exit 0)
- Unknown keys in `.iwe/config.toml` are rejected with a parse error (previously silently ignored)

### Fixed
- The `unknown projection source` error names the fix: frontmatter fields are bare names (`type`, not `$type`)

## [0.19.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.19.0...iwe-v0.19.1) - 2026-08-14

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.19.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.18.1...iwe-v0.19.0) - 2026-08-07

### Added
- `iwe init --okf` scaffolds an [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) v0.2 bundle: it writes the three conformance schemas into `.iwe/schemas/`, binds them in the configuration, sets `refs_extension` to `.md`, and creates a bundle-root `index.md` carrying `okf_version` when none exists. An existing `index.md` is left alone, and an explicit `--refs-extension` still wins.
- `!` negation in schema binding `match` patterns in `.iwe/config.toml` — patterns apply in order and the last matching one decides, gitignore-style, so a catch-all binding like `match = ["data/**", "!data/index"]` skips a reserved key and a later pattern can re-include what an earlier `!` removed.

## [0.18.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.18.0...iwe-v0.18.1) - 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- `iwe normalize` no longer empties links pointing at a hub document in a parent directory. A link from `a/b.md` to `a.md` stays `../a` (previously it was rewritten to an empty target).
- `iwe rename` and `iwe delete` now update links inside table cells, which used to silently keep pointing at the old document.

## [0.18.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.17.0...iwe-v0.18.0) - 2026-08-01

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.17.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.16.0...iwe-v0.17.0) - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `iwe create` creates documents in two explicit modes: content mode (`iwe create <key> --content`, or piped input) writes the complete document you pass byte for byte, and template mode (`--template NAME`) composes it from a named template, with your frontmatter written above the rendered output. Both accept `--strict` to validate against the document schema before writing.
- `iwe create --var NAME=VALUE` sets one template variable and uses the value verbatim as a string, so markdown like `--var body='## Notes'` arrives untouched; `--vars-yaml` and `--vars-json` take all the variables at once and keep their types, so templates can branch on booleans and loop over lists. `--set FIELD=VALUE` sets one frontmatter field written above the rendered document, repeat it for more. All of them require `--template`.

### Fixed
- `iwe update -c` no longer strands new frontmatter below the old block: content that carries its own frontmatter now replaces the existing one, and frontmatter closed with `...` is preserved (previously discarded).

## [0.16.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.15.0...iwe-v0.16.0) - 2026-07-26

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.15.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.14.0...iwe-v0.15.0) - 2026-07-22

### Added
- `stats similarity --threshold` (`-t`) — sets how close two pages must be to be reported as a match, defaulting to the previous fixed level of `0.85`; lower values list looser matches, higher values only closer ones.

## [0.14.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.13.0...iwe-v0.14.0) - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `docs` subcommand — prints the embedded query language, configuration, and document schema references (`iwe docs query`, `iwe docs config`, `iwe docs schema`); bare `iwe docs` lists the topics.
- `init` now fits the configuration to the existing files instead of writing a fixed template — it detects the library directory, source format, link style and path conventions, date formats, key naming, search language, and the markdown formatting tokens, and labels every value detected, assumed, or overridden.
- `init` measures how many files `iwe normalize` would rewrite under both the detected settings and the iwe defaults, and reports the two side by side before writing anything.
- `init` flags: `--auto` (`-y`) writes without prompting, `--dry-run` prints the proposal and writes nothing, `--defaults` keeps the old fixed template, `--json` emits a machine-readable report.
- `init` per-setting overrides applied on top of detection: `--library`, `--link-format`, `--refs-extension`, `--format`, `--date-format`.
- `init` reports findings that map to no setting — CRLF endings, setext headers, embeds and callouts, tag styles, frontmatter fields, duplicate titles, filename case collisions, and unresolved links.
- `init` can add an `<!-- iwe -->` section to `AGENTS.md` describing the graph's conventions and register the `iwec` MCP server in `.mcp.json`, offered when the directory already shows signs of agent use; the files are only written after an interactive confirmation — otherwise the snippets are printed instead.

### Changed
- `squash` keeps the source document's YAML frontmatter in its output (previously dropped).
- `init` at a terminal lists every setting with the detected value, marks the rows where detection differs from the defaults, and asks one question: write the detected settings or the defaults; with no terminal attached it behaves as `--auto` (previously it always wrote the fixed template with no output).
- `init` writes each detected value with a comment citing its evidence, and emits configuration sections in a stable order (previously the generated file's section order varied between runs).
- `init` sets the `link_type` of the generated `extract`, `extract_all`, and `link` actions to the chosen link format (was always `markdown`).
- `init` exits 2 when `.iwe` already exists and reports it on stderr (was: exit 0 with a message only visible under `--verbose`).

### Fixed
- Processing a document with an indented HTML block no longer crashes.

## [0.13.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.12.0...iwe-v0.13.0) - 2026-07-15

### Added
- `--filter` relational operators gain a `$size` count predicate — `--filter '$includedBy: { $size: 0 }'` finds roots, `--filter '$includes: { $size: 0 }'` finds leaves, `--filter '$referencedBy: { $size: { $gte: 5 } }'` finds hubs.

### Changed
- `--filter` relational operators default to direct edges (`maxDepth` / `maxDistance` 1) when the bound is omitted; an unbounded walk is now spelled `maxDepth: 0` / `maxDistance: 0` (was: omitting the bound meant unbounded). The structural anchor flags are unaffected — `--included-by KEY` was already direct and `--included-by KEY:0` is still unbounded.

## [0.12.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.11.0...iwe-v0.12.0) - 2026-07-12

### Added
- `refs_text` markdown option — `preserve` (default) keeps each markdown link's text as written; `normalize` makes `iwe normalize` and document output rewrite the text to the linked document's title.
- `iwe stats similarity` — list mutually near-identical page pairs across the store, each pair once and tab-separated in alphabetical order (forward matches computed once per page, concurrently).
- `iwe stats` gains an `Orphans` section listing every page with no incoming links (`index` pages are exempt as intentional entry points); per-document stats (`-k`) gain a `Similar page` line (markdown) / `similarPages` array (JSON/YAML) of near-identical documents.
- `iwe schema validate` — validate documents against the schemas bound to them by the `[schemas]` config section (each entry names a schema file in `.iwe/schemas/` and a glob that binds it to document keys). Reports violations as `-f text` (default) or `-f json`, and accepts the universal filter flags to scope the check. Exits `1` when any document has violations, `2` on a config or schema-file error, `0` when clean. Bare `iwe schema` still infers the frontmatter schema.
- `iwe schema validate --schema-file <PATH>` — validate the selected documents (`-k` or the filter flags) against a schema file directly, bypassing the `[schemas]` config bindings, for ad-hoc checks; violations are reported under the file's stem.
- `iwe schema validate --explain` — print the binding trace (which section and block bound to which schema entry, `additional` for the rest) instead of validating, to see how the greedy matcher reads a document against a schema.

### Changed
- `iwe normalize` and document rendering keep markdown link text as written by default; set `refs_text` to `normalize` to rewrite each link's text to the linked document's title (previously always rewritten).
- `update --strict` and `delete --strict` now reject a write that would leave a touched document violating its bound schema, aborting with exit `2` and the violation report before anything is written; previously `--strict` enforced only the `--expect` guards.
- `update --strict` and `delete --strict` also print non-blocking stats warnings to stderr after the schema gate — orphan pages and dangling links across the store, plus (on `update`) near-identical pages among the changed documents. They never change the exit code or block the write.

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.10.0...iwe-v0.11.0) - 2026-07-10

### Added
- `new --key <KEY>` — create a document at an explicit key, bypassing the template's key derivation. Subdirectory keys (e.g. `people/ada`) are allowed; omit the file extension.
- `new --if-exists fail` — report an error and exit non-zero when the document already exists. It is the default when `--key` is given (an explicit key asserts an identity), where previously an existing key silently gained a `-1` suffix.
- `retrieve --expand-includes` / `--expand-included-by` / `--expand-references` / `--expand-referenced-by` — one flag per expansion direction, each taking an optional depth (bare flag = one level, `0` = unbounded, omitted = not followed). `--expand-referenced-by` (pull documents that reference a seed) and transitive `--expand-references` are new directions.
- `retrieve --lexical` / `--fuzzy` — a one-shot form that searches for seed documents within the candidate set (`-k` / `--filter` / anchors) and then expands the graph around the ordered seeds.
- `retrieve --max-documents N` — cap the number of documents returned after expansion, trimming periphery documents first (`0` = unlimited).

### Changed
- `retrieve --limit` now caps the selected seed documents **before** expansion — top-N by relevance when searching, the first N of the selection otherwise (previously it capped the number of documents returned after expansion; use `--max-documents` for that).
- `retrieve` no longer expands by default: with no `--expand-*` flag (and no deprecated flag) it returns the requested document(s) only. The previous implicit `-d 1 -c 1` is now written explicitly as `--expand-includes 1 --expand-included-by 1`.

### Deprecated
- `retrieve -d` / `--depth`, `-c` / `--context`, `-l` / `--links` — retained as hidden aliases for `--expand-includes N` / `--expand-included-by N` / `--expand-references 1` (keeping their legacy `0` = off meaning). Passing one together with its `--expand-*` counterpart is an error.

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.9.0...iwe-v0.10.0) - 2026-07-09

### Added
- `refs_path` markdown option — set it to `absolute` to write links as root-absolute paths (`/dir/note.md`) on normalize, instead of the default paths relative to the linking document.

### Fixed
- Root-absolute links (a leading `/`, such as `/dir/note.md`) and links carrying a `#fragment` now resolve from any directory. Previously such links were dropped from the graph unless the linking file sat at the library root, so `tree`, `stats`, `retrieve`, and backlinks under-reported references.

## [0.9.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.8.0...iwe-v0.9.0) - 2026-07-09

### Added
- `--project` / `--add-fields` accept block-addressed sources: `{ $content: PREDICATE }` narrows a document's body to the selected blocks (rendered at their original depth), `$blocks` / `{ $blocks: PREDICATE }` lists each selected block as `type` / `path` / `text` data, and `{ $matches: REGEX }` greps matching lines with their section paths.
- `find` markdown output renders `$blocks` and `$matches` entries one line each as `key › section path › text`, and switches to the fenced-block form with the narrowed body when a parameterized `$content` field is projected.
- `--project` accepts a bare block predicate — `--project '$header: {}'` renders each document's body narrowed to the selected blocks (the headers-only form) under `key` and `content` fields, so `--format json`/`yaml` output keeps the document identity that the markdown fence already carries.
- `update` gains a block-edit flag per operator — `--replace`, `--replace-text`, `--insert-before`, `--insert-after`, `--append`, `--delete` — each taking a `{ <selector>, payload }` mapping and composing with `--set` / `--unset` into one atomic update. A validation failure (unmet `expect`, overlapping selections, incompatible target) prints the offending blocks and exits non-zero without writing. `--replace-text` accepts a `from`-less argument (`{ $header: Goals, to: Aims }`) that rewrites the block's entire own text — the clean way to rename a header or restate a line.
- A block edit targeting a `$header` acts on the heading line alone: `--delete '{ $header: Goals }'` dissolves the section (contents re-attach to the parent and re-level) and `--replace '{ $header: Goals, content: "## Aims" }'` retitles it (contents kept), while `--delete '{ $section: Goals }'` removes the whole tree. `--insert-after '{ $header: Goals, content: ... }'` adds content at the top of the section, below the heading line.
- `update` and `delete` gain `--expect` — a document-level guard asserting the number of matched documents (`N` or `{ min, max }`); on a mismatch the command lists the matched documents as `key › title` and exits non-zero without writing. Both also gain `--strict`, which requires an `expect` guard on every mutating application (the document-level `--expect` and each block operator's `expect`) and aborts before writing if any is missing; `--dry-run` is exempt so counts can be learned.
- `find --blocks PRED` adds a `blocks` field listing each block matching the predicate (lowers to `addFields: { blocks: { $blocks: PRED } }`), and `find --matches PATTERN` restricts results to documents whose content matches PATTERN and adds a `matches` grep field (lowers to a `$content` membership filter plus `addFields: { matches: { $matches: PATTERN } }`).
- `find --filter` accepts the `$content` block-membership operator — `--filter '$content: { $header: Status }'` selects documents that contain at least one block satisfying the predicate.

### Changed
- `update -k` / `--key` is repeatable, matching `find`: one key lowers to `$eq`, two or more to `$in` (body-overwrite mode still takes exactly one). Previously it accepted a single key only.
- `update` writes only documents whose rendered content actually changes and reports honestly — `Updated N document(s)` when every matched document changed, `Matched N document(s), M changed` otherwise (`No documents matched` when none) — so a no-op edit (e.g. `expect: 0`) leaves the file, and its mtime, untouched.

### Fixed
- `--project` / `--add-fields` now parse the argument as a YAML mapping whenever it contains a `:` or `{`, and report a parse error on malformed input instead of silently falling back to the comma list. Previously an unbraced multi-field mapping like `--project 'a: { $content: ... }, b: { $content: ... }'` failed the YAML parse, degraded to the comma list, and emitted `a: null, b: null` with no error. The comma list keeps the `name`, `name=source`, and bare `$selector` forms; write multi-field or block projections as a braced mapping.

## [0.8.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.7.0...iwe-v0.8.0) - 2026-07-07

### Added
- `find` gains explicit `--fuzzy` (subsequence match on document title and key) and `--lexical` (BM25 full-text scoring over title and body) query flags; supplying both fuses the two result sets with Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Set the stemming language for lexical search with `[search] language` in `.iwe/config.toml`.
- `find --lexical` prints a warning when the query reduces to only stop words after stemming, so an empty result set is explained instead of looking like an empty index.

### Fixed
- `find` and `retrieve` truncation warning now suggests only the limits that actually apply (`--limit`, `--max-tokens`, `--max-document-tokens`) instead of always naming `--max-tokens`, which does nothing for a metadata-only index bounded by `--limit`.

### Deprecated
- `find`'s bare positional query defaults to fuzzy matching and now prints a warning on stderr; it will be removed in a future release. Use `--fuzzy` or `--lexical` instead.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.6.1...iwe-v0.7.0) - 2026-07-03

### Added
- `retrieve --limit`, and `--max-tokens` / `--max-document-tokens` on `retrieve` and `find`, to bound output for context-limited callers. `0` disables a limit. A `warning:` line is printed to stderr when output is truncated.

### Changed
- `find` markdown output is now a compact index (one line per document) instead of full document blocks; a document body is rendered only when the projection includes `$content` (via `--project` / `--add-fields`). Use `retrieve` for full content.

### Removed
- `retrieve --no-content` — removed; `retrieve` always returns content. Use `find` for a metadata-only index.
- `retrieve --dry-run` — removed.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.6.0...iwe-v0.6.1) - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- `retrieve --backlinks` can now be turned off: `--backlinks false` disables incoming references, while a bare `--backlinks` (and the default) still includes them. Previously the flag was stuck on and `--backlinks false` was rejected outright.
- `stats -k <key>` accepts a key written with a `.md`/`.dj` extension (`stats -k note.md`) instead of reporting the document as not found.
- `find --format keys` combined with `--project` now prints the matched keys instead of nothing.
- `attach` reports an error and exits instead of crashing when an action's `key_template` or `document_template` is malformed; `attach --list` and `--dry-run` are affected too.
- `schema` and `find --filter '{$type: datetime}'` no longer crash when a document holds a datetime value with multibyte characters.

## [0.6.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.5.0...iwe-v0.6.0) - 2026-06-27

### Added
- `preserve_newlines` config option keeps each line of a paragraph on its own line during `normalize` instead of joining them with spaces, so source files written with one sentence per line (semantic line breaks) survive formatting (default off).

### Fixed
- `normalize` no longer collapses nested or multi-paragraph djot list items onto one line; the blank line that keeps them separate is preserved so the list survives repeated runs.
- Commands no longer crash on a djot document that contains a reference link definition or a definition list.
- `normalize` keeps the word boundary at a hard line break instead of running the surrounding words together.
- `normalize` preserves djot task list checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`), display math (`$$`), and autolinks (`<url>`) instead of mangling them.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.4.0...iwe-v0.5.0) - 2026-06-23

### Added
- `format` config option (`markdown` | `djot`, default `markdown`) selects the document format, with a matching `[djot]` options table. With `format = "djot"`, `iwe` reads, normalizes, exports, and creates [djot](https://djot.net/) documents and works with `.dj` files instead of `.md`.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.3.2...iwe-v0.4.0) - 2026-06-22

### Fixed
- Normalization now preserves escaped Markdown literals (such as `\*text\*`, a leading `\#`, or `\[label\](url)`) instead of dropping the backslashes and re-interpreting the text as live markup.

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.3.1...iwe-v0.3.2) - 2026-06-05

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.3.0...iwe-v0.3.1) - 2026-06-03

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.2.0...iwe-v0.3.0) - 2026-06-02

### Added

- `markdown.wiki_link_path` config option (`preserve` | `full` | `short`, default `preserve`) controls how `iwe normalize` and `iwe export` write the path inside a wiki link: `preserve` keeps each link as typed, `full` rewrites to the target's full key path, and `short` rewrites to the shortest unambiguous suffix. `iwe init` now writes the option in the generated config.

### Changed

- `iwe normalize` now recognizes task-list markers in list items (`- [ ]`, `- [x]`) and normalizes `[X]` to lowercase `[x]`
- List items are now a distinct node type rather than sections, so `iwe stats` no longer counts them toward the section total and `iwe extract` no longer lists them as extractable sections (section and `--block` numbers shift accordingly)

### Fixed

- Wiki link shortening no longer rewrites a link whose target is missing from the document set onto an unrelated document that shares the same file name; such links keep their full path.
## [0.2.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.10...iwe-v0.2.0) - 2026-06-02

### Added

- `markdown.formatting.ordered_list_content_indent` and `markdown.formatting.bullet_list_content_indent` config options set the minimum indentation for list item content and continuation lines (accepts `2`–`4`); set either to `4` for MkDocs-style alignment (`1.  item` / `-   item` with 4-space continuation) instead of the default single space after the marker

### Fixed

- `iwe normalize` now renders a list as loose (a blank line between items) when any item contains a code block, table, blockquote, or horizontal rule, so a following item is no longer glued directly under the preceding item's block (previously only items with multiple paragraphs triggered loose rendering)

## [0.1.10](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.9...iwe-v0.1.10) - 2026-05-30

### Fixed

- `iwe normalize` now inserts a blank line between a list item's text and an adjacent code block, table, blockquote, or horizontal rule (previously the block was glued directly under the item text)

## [0.1.9](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.8...iwe-v0.1.9) - 2026-05-27

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.1.8](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.7...iwe-v0.1.8) - 2026-05-23

### Added

- `iwe normalize` honors three new `[markdown.formatting]` options: `wrap_column` wraps paragraphs at the configured column, `preserve_line_breaks` keeps hard line breaks instead of dropping them, and `line_break_style` (`"backslash"` | `"spaces"`, default `"backslash"`) selects how preserved breaks are emitted.

## [0.1.7](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.6...iwe-v0.1.7) - 2026-05-20

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.1.6](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.5...iwe-v0.1.6) - 2026-05-17

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.1.5](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.4...iwe-v0.1.5) - 2026-05-16

### Fixed

- `iwe normalize` preserves links to non-markdown files (e.g. `foo.html`, `foo.pdf`) instead of appending `.md` to them
- `iwe attach` writes the link with a path relative to the target file's directory and honours `markdown.refs_extension`

### Changed

- `iwe attach` creates new target documents from `document_template` (was a synthesised `# <action title>` heading)

## [0.1.4](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.3...iwe-v0.1.4) - 2026-05-15

### Added

- `iwe completions <SHELL>` subcommand — prints a shell completion script to stdout for `bash`, `elvish`, `fish`, `nushell`, `powershell`, or `zsh`

### Fixed

- `iwe normalize` no longer corrupts links that contain a fragment anchor when `refs_extension` is set — the extension was being appended after the fragment, producing malformed URLs

## [0.1.3](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.2...iwe-v0.1.3) - 2026-05-05

Workspace version bump — no user-visible changes in this crate.

## [0.1.2](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.1...iwe-v0.1.2) - 2026-05-04

### Changed

- `--filter` accepts the natural form `{type: tracker, $or: [...]}` directly — bare field keys may be mixed with `$and`/`$or`/`$nor`/`$key`/graph operators at the filter root and inside logical-operator branches, combining via implicit AND (previously rejected; required the explicit `{$and: [{type: tracker}, {$or: [...]}]}` rewrite).
- `--not-in KEY` deprecation warning now points to `--filter '$nor: [{ $includedBy: ... }]'` (was: `--filter '$not: { $includedBy: ... }'`).

### Removed

- Top-level `$not` in `--filter` expressions. `$not` is now field-level only (matching MongoDB): `--filter 'priority: { $not: { $gt: 5 } }'` still works; `--filter '$not: { status: archived }'` is now a parse-time error and should be rewritten as `--filter '$nor: [{ status: archived }]'`. The error message points to `$nor`.

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.1.0...iwe-v0.1.1) - 2026-05-03

### Added

- `iwe schema` command for frontmatter structure analysis — emits per-field type distribution, coverage, and distinct values; supports `-f markdown|json|yaml`, `--field NAME` to scope output, and the universal filter flags ([#274](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/pull/274))

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/compare/iwe-v0.0.70...iwe-v0.1.0) - 2026-05-01

### Added

- `iwe count` command — returns an integer count of matched documents, mirroring the `find` filter semantics
- Universal `--filter "<YAML>"` flag for inline query expressions on `find`, `count`, `retrieve`, `tree`, `export`, `delete`, and `update`
- Structural anchor flags — `-k/--key` (repeatable), `--includes`, `--included-by`, `--references`, `--referenced-by`, with `KEY[:DEPTH]` syntax
- `--max-depth` and `--max-distance` defaults applied to anchor flags lacking an explicit colon-suffix
- `--project f1,f2` and `-f json` on `find`, `tree`, and `retrieve` for projecting frontmatter fields into structured output
- `iwe update` command with body-overwrite (`-k -c`) and frontmatter mutation (`--filter` + `--set`/`--unset`) modes, plus `--dry-run`
- `retrieve --children` flag to populate the `includes` array independently of `--no-content`
- `retrieve --dry-run` honors `-f json|yaml` and emits a structured `{documents, lines}` object in those formats
- `tree --project f1,f2` to add user frontmatter fields to each tree node alongside `key`, `title`, `children`

### Changed

- Help text refreshed across `count`, `delete`, `extract`, `find`, `inline`, `rename`, `retrieve`, `stats`, `tree`, and `update`
- `find` JSON/YAML output is now a bare array of result objects (the `{query, limit, total, results}` envelope is removed)
- `retrieve` JSON/YAML output is now a bare array of document objects (the `{documents}` envelope is removed)
- `find` result objects flatten user frontmatter at the top level alongside `key`, `title`, `includedBy`; the nested `frontmatter` object is removed
- `retrieve` `includes` entries now carry `sectionPath` (unified `EdgeRef` shape with `includedBy` and `referencedBy`)
- `retrieve --no-content` no longer populates `includes` — use `--children` for that, and combine with `--no-content` for metadata-only output with edges
- `tree` JSON/YAML always emits `children: []` for leaf nodes (previously omitted)
- Markdown frontmatter rendered by `retrieve` uses `includedBy` / `referencedBy` instead of `parents` / `back-links`
- `stats -k KEY` rejects `-f markdown` and `-f csv` at parse time (was silently falling through to JSON)

### Removed

- `--roots` flag — removed

### Deprecated

- `--in`, `--in-any`, `--not-in`, `--refs-to`, `--refs-from` retained as hidden aliases for the new spec-named structural anchor flags
