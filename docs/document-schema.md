# Document Schema

A document schema declares the required shape of a page: which frontmatter
fields it carries, which sections it contains and in what order, how headers
are written, how deep the heading tree may nest, and how large each part may
grow. Schemas are checked by [`iwe schema validate`](cli-schema.md), so a
store's conventions become machine-checked policy in the loop
*write → validate → fix*.

The language is JSON-Schema-aligned. Frontmatter is validated by literal
JSON Schema (draft 2020-12). The body schema mirrors the document's own
structure — a document has `sections`, a section has a `header` and its own
nested `sections` — and keyword names and semantics come from JSON Schema
wherever the concept maps: `pattern`, `const`, `enum`, `minLength`,
`maxLength`, `minContains`, `maxContains`, `additionalSections` (after
`additionalProperties`), `description`.

A complete schema:

``` yaml
$schema: https://document-schema.org/draft/2026-06/schema
frontmatter:
  type: object
  required: [status]
  properties:
    status: { enum: [draft, published] }
maxTokens: 1200
sections:
  - header: { pattern: "^[A-Z]", maxTokens: 12 }
    maxContains: 1
    sections:
      - header: { const: Summary }
        maxContains: 1
        description: every note opens with a summary
      - header: { const: Tasks }
        maxContains: 1
additionalSections: false
```

This reads: the frontmatter declares a `status`; the page body stays under
1200 tokens; there is exactly one top-level section, its header capitalized
and at most 12 tokens; it contains a `Summary` section and then a `Tasks`
section, in that order; no other top-level sections are allowed.

## 1. Schema documents

Schemas live in `.iwe/schemas/<name>.yaml`, one schema per file. Files are
YAML 1.2, so JSON content is equally valid. The optional `$schema` key names
the dialect; only `https://document-schema.org/draft/2026-06/schema` is accepted.

A schema binds to documents through the `[schemas]` section of
`.iwe/config.toml` (see [Configuration](configuration.md)):

``` toml
[schemas.note]
match = "notes/**"

[schemas.session]
match = ["journal/*", "meetings/**"]
```

The entry name is the schema name — `[schemas.note]` resolves to
`.iwe/schemas/note.yaml`. `match` is a glob, or a list of globs, matched
against the document key: `*` stays within a path segment, `**` crosses
segments, and a leading `/` is optional. A `!` prefix negates a pattern —
within one list patterns apply in order and the last matching one decides,
gitignore-style, so `["notes/**", "!notes/index"]` binds everything under
`notes/` except the index. Bindings compose order-free — a document is
validated against **every** schema whose `match` hits, so overlapping
bindings compose (as JSON Schema `allOf` does). A document matching no entry
is unvalidated.

Every keyword in a schema is optional, and an absent keyword constrains
nothing. An empty schema (`{}`) passes every document.

## 2. What is validated

- **The section tree.** Sections at their structural depth after
  normalization (`1` for `#`, `2` for `##`). A section's subsections are its
  `sections`, in document order. Non-section content — paragraphs, lists,
  code blocks, tables — is invisible to the schema: it is never matched and
  never violates.
- **Header text.** The rendered plain text of a heading, inline markup
  stripped.
- **Token counts.** The same counting as the retrieve budgets, over rendered
  text, frontmatter excluded.
- **The frontmatter mapping.** `{}` when the page has no frontmatter. Every
  field is presented to the validator, at every depth, whatever its name
  starts with — a stored query keyed on `$includedBy` validates like any
  other mapping. YAML dates and datetimes are presented to the validator as
  ISO-8601 / RFC 3339 strings.

## 3. Document schema

The top level of a schema file:

| Keyword              | Value                          | Meaning                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `$schema`            | string                         | optional dialect id                                                     |
| `description`        | string                         | default hint for document-level violations                              |
| `frontmatter`        | JSON Schema                    | validates the frontmatter mapping                                       |
| `maxTokens`          | integer                        | budget for the whole rendered body                                      |
| `maxDepth`           | integer                        | maximum heading nesting (`3` allows `###`, forbids `####`)              |
| `allSections`        | reduced section schema (§6)    | applies to every section at every depth                                 |
| `sections`           | array of section schemas       | ordered shapes for the top-level sections                               |
| `additionalSections` | bool or reduced section schema | policy for top-level sections matching no entry; default `true` (open)  |
| `blocks`             | array of block schemas (§8)    | ordered shapes for the content above the first heading                  |
| `additionalBlocks`   | bool or reduced block schema   | policy for that content matching no entry; default `true`               |
| `allBlocks`          | reduced block schema (§8)      | applies to every block at every depth                                   |

The `frontmatter` value is standard JSON Schema, draft 2020-12, with
`format` assertions enabled. Only in-document references (`#/...`) are
allowed; external and remote `$ref` are rejected.

## 4. Section schema

An item in a `sections` array is always a section.

| Keyword              | Value                          | Meaning                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `header`             | header schema (§5)             | constrains the header text; also decides binding (§7)                     |
| `maxTokens`          | integer                        | budget for this section's subtree, header included                        |
| `maxDepth`           | integer                        | maximum nesting below this section (`1` allows children, forbids deeper)  |
| `minContains`        | integer, default `1`           | minimum occurrences of this shape; `0` makes it optional                  |
| `maxContains`        | integer, default unbounded     | maximum occurrences                                                       |
| `description`        | string                         | the violation hint for anything failing in this entry                     |
| `allSections`        | reduced section schema         | applies to every section below this one                                   |
| `sections`           | array of section schemas       | ordered shapes for the subsections                                        |
| `additionalSections` | bool or reduced section schema | policy for subsections matching no entry; default `true`                  |
| `blocks`             | array of block schemas (§8)    | ordered shapes for this section's content blocks                          |
| `additionalBlocks`   | bool or reduced block schema   | policy for content blocks matching no entry; default `true`               |
| `allBlocks`          | reduced block schema (§8)      | applies to every block below this section                                 |

The occurrence defaults are JSON Schema's `contains` defaults: a listed
shape is required at least once and unbounded above. The recipes:

| Intent                  | Spelling                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| one or more (default)   | nothing                          |
| optional                | `minContains: 0`                 |
| exactly one             | `maxContains: 1`                 |
| at most one             | `minContains: 0, maxContains: 1` |
| n or more               | `minContains: n`                 |
| exactly n               | `minContains: n, maxContains: n` |

## 5. Header schema

Applies to the header's plain text. The string keywords carry JSON Schema
semantics exactly; `maxTokens` is the one extension.

| Keyword       | Meaning                                                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pattern`     | regex the text must match; unanchored, as in JSON Schema — write `^...$` for a full match  |
| `const`       | the text equals this string                                                                 |
| `enum`        | the text equals one of these strings                                                        |
| `minLength`   | minimum length in characters                                                                |
| `maxLength`   | maximum length in characters                                                                |
| `maxTokens`   | maximum tokens in the header text                                                           |
| `description` | hint override for header violations                                                         |

`const` is in principle an anchored, regex-escaped `pattern`
(`const: Tasks` ≡ `pattern: "^Tasks$"` with metacharacters escaped), but it
is a distinct keyword for three reasons: JSON Schema alignment; escaping
safety for literal headers containing regex metacharacters (a header like
`C++ (Draft)` needs no escaping under `const`); and error naming — a
missing-section message takes the section's name from `const` directly.
Mind the asymmetry: `pattern` is unanchored, so `pattern: Tasks` matches
any header *containing* "Tasks", while `const: Tasks` matches exactly.
`enum` is a disjunction of consts. `enum` and `const` cannot be combined.

> **Quoting regexes in YAML.** A backslash class like `\d` is an invalid
> escape inside a YAML double-quoted string. Write patterns in **single
> quotes** — `pattern: '^\d{4}$'` — or double the backslashes.

## 6. Reduced section schemas

`allSections` and a schema-valued `additionalSections` take a **reduced**
section schema: `header`, `maxTokens`, `maxDepth`, and `description` only.
Occurrence keywords are meaningless there — `allSections` applies to every
section, `additionalSections` applies per leftover section — and structural
keywords (`sections`, `additionalSections`, `allSections`) are not allowed
inside them. When several `allSections` are in scope (the document's plus
enclosing sections'), all of them apply.

`additionalSections` is **boolean or schema**, matching JSON Schema's own
value form for array extras (`items` after `prefixItems`, draft-07's
`additionalItems`, `unevaluatedItems` — all schema-or-boolean, all open by
default). `true` allows leftover sections unconstrained, a schema validates
each leftover against it, `false` makes each leftover a violation.
Semantically it is closest to `unevaluatedItems`: it governs the sections
no listed shape claimed.

## 7. Matching semantics

For each node — the document, then each bound section, recursively — the
node's sections are matched against its `sections` entries. Matching is
**ordered, sequential, and greedy, without backtracking**:

1. Walk the instance sections in document order, holding a pointer into the
   entry list, starting at the first entry.
2. For each section, find the first entry — at the pointer or later — whose
   **`header` schema** the section's header text satisfies (an entry with no
   `header` matches any section). Bind the section to that entry and advance
   the pointer to it. Entries before the pointer are closed and never bind
   again.
3. A section that satisfies no entry at or after the pointer — including one
   that would only match an already-closed entry, i.e. out of order — is
   **additional** and is handled by `additionalSections`.
4. After the walk, every entry's bound count is checked against
   `minContains` and `maxContains`. An entry bound fewer than `minContains`
   times reports a missing required section, named by its `const`, else
   `enum`, else `pattern`, else its position.
5. Each bound section is then validated against the rest of its entry:
   `maxTokens`, `maxDepth`, `allSections`, and the nested `sections`
   matching, recursively.

Consequences:

- **Binding is decided by `header` alone.** A `Tasks` section missing its
  required subsections still binds to the `Tasks` entry and reports the
  missing pieces — it does not fall through to `additionalSections`.
- Occurrences are counted in **total**, not per consecutive run. A repeated
  entry stays open and keeps binding matching sections until the pointer
  advances past it — which happens only when a section binds to a *later*
  entry. An **additional** section (one matching no open entry) does not
  advance the pointer, so a matching section after it rejoins the same entry.
  Hence `date, date, other, date` counts as three dates: it satisfies
  `minContains: 3` and violates `maxContains: 2`. `minContains` / `maxContains`
  bound the total, not the length of an unbroken run.
- A headerless (wildcard) entry greedily absorbs every remaining section, so
  any entry after it can never bind — a wildcard must be the last entry.
  Placing one earlier is rejected as a schema error (§10); `maxContains` does
  not rescue it, since the wildcard still binds every match first.
- There is no backtracking: matching is deterministic and errors are
  explainable. Order entries specific-first.

## 8. Blocks

The schema also reaches below the section, to a section's **content** —
paragraphs, lists, code, quotes, tables, rules. The vocabulary
mirrors the section level one step down: where a section has `sections`, it
also has `blocks`; where a `header` constrains a section's title, `text`
constrains a block's content; the `all*` / `additional*` / occurrence machinery
and the [matching algorithm](#7-matching-semantics) are reused verbatim.

### 8.1 What a block is

Every piece of non-section content is a **block**: a `type`, plain `text`
(empty for containers), a token count, and — for containers — child blocks.
The seven types map onto the document model:

| `type`         | content                       | its `text`         | type-only keywords                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `paragraph`    | a paragraph                   | the paragraph text | —                                         |
| `bullet-list`  | a `-`/`*`/`+` list            | (empty)            | `items`, `minItems`, `maxItems`           |
| `ordered-list` | a `1.`/`1)` list              | (empty)            | `items`, `minItems`, `maxItems`           |
| `code`         | a fenced / raw code block     | the code body      | `lang`                                    |
| `quote`        | a block quote                 | (empty)            | `blocks`, `additionalBlocks`, `allBlocks` |
| `table`        | a table                       | the cell text      | —                                         |
| `rule`         | a horizontal rule             | (empty)            | —                                         |

An inclusion link (a lone reference to another document) is not a distinct
type; it is matched as a `paragraph` whose `text` is the link text.

Bullet and ordered lists are **distinct types** — there is no `ordered` flag.
A list's elements are its **items**; an item is itself a container (its own
`text` plus nested `blocks`), shaped through `items` (§8.4).

A section's children are its content blocks **followed by** its subsections —
subsections never interleave. The two arrays partition the children cleanly:
**`blocks` matches the leading content, `sections` matches the subsections.**
The document's top level works the same way — `blocks` there is the content
above the first heading.

### 8.2 Block keywords on the document and every section

| Keyword            | Value                        | Meaning                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blocks`           | array of block schemas       | ordered shapes for this node's content blocks               |
| `additionalBlocks` | bool or reduced block schema | policy for content blocks matching no entry; default `true` |
| `allBlocks`        | reduced block schema         | applies to every block at every depth below this node       |

`allBlocks` is to blocks what `allSections` is to sections; when several are in
scope (document, enclosing sections, enclosing containers) all apply.

### 8.3 Block schema — an entry in a `blocks` array

| Keyword            | Value                        | Meaning                                                        | Types   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `type`             | one of the seven, or a list  | the block kind(s); part of the binding identity (§8.5)         | all     |
| `text`             | text schema (§5)             | constrains the block's plain text; part of the binding identity | all   |
| `maxTokens`        | integer                      | budget for this block's whole subtree                          | all     |
| `minContains`      | integer, default `1`         | minimum occurrences of this shape                              | all     |
| `maxContains`      | integer, default unbounded   | maximum occurrences                                            | all     |
| `description`      | string                       | violation hint for anything failing in this entry             | all     |
| `lang`             | text schema (§5)             | constrains the code language; part of the binding identity     | `code`  |
| `items`            | item schema (§8.4)           | schema applied to every list item                             | lists   |
| `minItems`         | integer                      | minimum number of list items                                  | lists   |
| `maxItems`         | integer                      | maximum number of list items                                  | lists   |
| `blocks`           | array of block schemas       | ordered shapes for the quote's child blocks                   | `quote` |
| `additionalBlocks` | bool or reduced block schema | policy for the quote's child blocks matching no entry         | `quote` |
| `allBlocks`        | reduced block schema         | applies to every block inside the quote                       | `quote` |

`text` and `lang` reuse the [header schema shape](#5-header-schema):
`pattern`, `const`, `enum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `maxTokens`,
`description`. A keyword used on the wrong type — `lang` on a `paragraph`,
`items` on a `code`, `blocks` on a `table` — is a load error (§10), as is an
unknown `type` value.

`type` may also be a **list** of type names — `type: [bullet-list,
ordered-list]` binds a block whose kind is any one of them, the block analogue
of a header `enum`. A type-specific keyword is then allowed only when every
listed type accepts it (`items` on `[bullet-list, ordered-list]` is fine;
`items` on `[bullet-list, code]` is a load error).

Two token budgets, mirroring `header.maxTokens` vs a section's `maxTokens`:
`text: { maxTokens }` bounds the block's **own** text, block `maxTokens` bounds
its whole subtree. For a paragraph they coincide; for a list or quote the
subtree includes the children.

### 8.4 Lists and items

A list (`bullet-list` / `ordered-list`) bounds its length with
`minItems` / `maxItems` and shapes each item with `items` — one schema applied
to **every** item. Repetition uses this pair, not repeated entries: one-to-ten
items is `{ type: bullet-list, minItems: 1, maxItems: 10 }`.

> **`minItems` is not `minContains`.** Both `minItems` and `maxItems` default
> to *unbounded* — omitting `minItems` means **no minimum** (an empty list
> passes). This differs from `minContains`, which defaults to `1`. So a
> `bullet-list` entry with nothing set is required to appear (via
> `minContains: 1`) but may itself be empty until you add `minItems`.

An **item schema** is a container without `type` or occurrence: `text` (the
item's own text), `maxTokens` (the item's subtree), `description`, and its own
`blocks` / `additionalBlocks` / `allBlocks` for the item's nested content.
Containers nest without limit — a quote holding a list whose items hold
paragraphs is fully expressible, and an `allBlocks` in scope at any container
reaches every block beneath it.

### 8.5 Block matching

Within a node, its content blocks are matched against its `blocks` entries by
the **same ordered, greedy, no-backtracking algorithm as sections**
([§7](#7-matching-semantics)) — the only difference is the binding identity. A
block binds to the first entry at or after the pointer whose **`type`** matches
(an entry with no `type` matches any block; a list `type` matches any of its
kinds) **and** whose `text` / `lang` identity (`const`, `enum`, `pattern`), if
present, the block satisfies. Blocks matching no open entry are **additional**,
governed by
`additionalBlocks`. After the walk, `minContains` / `maxContains` are tallied,
each bound block is validated against the rest of its entry, and every
`allBlocks` in scope applies to every block throughout. A missing required
block is named by its `text` `const` / `enum` when present, else its `type`,
else its position.

Every §7 consequence carries over — in particular, **two entries with the same
identity are rejected at load (§10): the second could never bind.** Write "two
to four lead paragraphs" as `{ type: paragraph, minContains: 2, maxContains: 4 }`,
never as repeated `{ type: paragraph }` entries.

### 8.6 Reduced block schema

`allBlocks` and a schema-valued `additionalBlocks` take a **reduced** block
schema — `text`, `maxTokens`, `description` only. Type-specific keywords
(`type`, `lang`, `items`), structural keywords (`blocks`,
`additionalBlocks`, `allBlocks`), and occurrence keywords (`minContains`,
`maxContains`, `minItems`, `maxItems`) are rejected there, mirroring the
[reduced section schema](#6-reduced-section-schemas).

### 8.7 Examples

Every line short — no paragraph, list item, table cell, or code body over 40
tokens, anywhere. `text` is the block's *own* text, so this never trips on a
long list's total:

``` yaml
allBlocks:
  text: { maxTokens: 40 }
```

A hub page — one lead paragraph, then a bulleted index of short links, nothing
else:

``` yaml
sections:
  - header: { pattern: ".+" }
    blocks:
      - type: paragraph
        maxContains: 1
      - type: bullet-list
        minItems: 1
        items:
          text: { maxTokens: 40 }
    additionalBlocks: false
```

A code-sample section — exactly one fenced block in an allowed language:

``` yaml
blocks:
  - type: code
    lang: { enum: [rust, toml, bash] }
    maxContains: 1
```

## 9. Violations

`iwe schema validate` reports one line per violation, `<key> › <breadcrumb>:
<message>` (or `<key>: <message>` when the breadcrumb is empty). The
breadcrumb is built from the matched header texts — a position like
`sections[2]` where no header text is available, `blocks[1]` / `items[3]` for
content blocks and list items, a frontmatter path like `frontmatter › status`.
A `hint:` line follows when a hint is present:

``` text
journal/2026-01-05 › Tasks: header is 18 tokens (limit 12)
  hint: keep section headers short
notes/intro: required section 'Summary' missing
  hint: every note opens with a summary
notes/intro › frontmatter › status: not one of 'draft', 'published'
```

The hint is the nearest `description` walking outward from the failing
keyword — header schema, then entry, then enclosing entries, then the
document schema. Without one, no hint line is shown.

`-f json` output is an array of `{ key, schema, violations }` objects; each
violation additionally carries the machine paths `schemaPath` (a JSON Pointer
into the schema file, e.g. `/sections/0/sections/1/header`) and the failing
`keyword`. A document bound to several schemas yields one report per schema.
The command exits `1` when any document has a violation, `0` when the store is
clean.

## 10. Schema errors

These are configuration errors — `iwe schema validate` prints them to stderr
and exits `2` before validating any document, rather than reporting them as
violations:

- a `[schemas]` entry naming a schema file that does not exist;
- an invalid glob in a `[schemas]` entry's `match`;
- a `frontmatter` subschema that fails the 2020-12 meta-schema, or contains
  an external or remote `$ref`;
- an unknown keyword anywhere outside `frontmatter` — unlike JSON Schema,
  unknown keywords are rejected, so a typo cannot silently validate nothing
  (`ordered` is not a keyword, so it reports as unknown);
- an unknown block `type`, an empty `type` list, or a type-specific block
  keyword on the wrong type (`lang` off `code`, `items` off a list, `blocks`
  off `quote` — for a list `type`, every listed type must accept the keyword);
- an invalid `pattern` regex, a negative count, `minContains` greater than
  `maxContains`, `minItems` greater than `maxItems`, or `enum` and `const`
  together;
- occurrence or structural keywords inside a reduced section or block schema;
- an **unreachable entry** in a `sections` or `blocks` array — a wildcard entry
  (one with no identity constraint) that is not last, since it absorbs every
  match and starves the entries after it; or an entry whose identity exactly
  duplicates an earlier one, since the earlier always binds first.

## 11. Freeze

`freeze: true` on a document's own frontmatter rejects every write to
that document — the body, and any frontmatter field, including `freeze`
itself — unconditionally, on every write path (CLI `create` / `update` /
`delete` / `rename` / `extract` / `inline` / `attach` / `normalize`, and
the MCP write tools). It is checked at write time, not by `iwe schema
validate`, and applies regardless of which schema (if any) the document
is bound to:

```markdown
---
status: signed
freeze: true
---

# Signed Contract

The terms below are final.
```

A rejected write reports `write to '<key>' rejected: document is frozen
(unset 'freeze' to allow writes)`. Only a literal `true` freezes;
`freeze: false`, an absent field, or a non-boolean value leaves the
document writable.

Lifting freeze is itself write-checked: a write to a frozen document is
rejected unless its sole effect is lifting the freeze — the result must
be identical to the prior document in every frontmatter property and the
body, except no longer frozen. Removing the `freeze` field entirely
counts as lifting it, under the same sole-effect rule. Other changes ride
in the next write, which faces the now-unfrozen document normally.
Freezing an unfrozen document is unrestricted.

## 12. Per-property mutability

The schema keyword `mutable` maps a property selector — `$content` for
the document body, or a dotted frontmatter path — to `true` or `false`,
protecting specific fields (a tooling-maintained `checksum`, an `id` set
once at creation) while the rest of the document stays freely authored:

```yaml
mutable:
  $content: false
  id: false
  archived: true
```

A property absent from `mutable` entirely — including every property on a
document whose schema never mentions the keyword — is mutable by default;
`mutable` only ever restricts. A write to a property marked `mutable:
false` is rejected, naming the document, the rule, and the specific
property: `write rejected: document '<key>', rule 'mutable: false',
property '<selector>'` (with `(the document body)` appended for
`$content`).

Like `freeze`, this is checked at write time on every write path, not by
`iwe schema validate`. **Freeze dominates**: when a document is both
frozen and carries a property explicitly marked `mutable: true`, the
write is rejected as frozen, and `mutable` is never consulted.

## 13. Examples

Header discipline for a whole store — every header capitalized and short,
every section within budget, nothing deeper than `###`:

``` yaml
maxDepth: 3
allSections:
  header: { pattern: "^[A-Z]", maxLength: 60 }
  maxTokens: 400
```

A log page — at least three dated entries, each small, extra sections
allowed but budgeted:

``` yaml
sections:
  - header: { pattern: '^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$' }
    minContains: 3
    maxTokens: 150
additionalSections:
  maxTokens: 300
```

A docs page — Installation and Usage required in order, Configuration
optional:

``` yaml
sections:
  - header: { pattern: ".+" }
    maxContains: 1
    sections:
      - header: { const: Installation }
      - header: { const: Usage }
      - header: { const: Configuration }
        minContains: 0
```

Frontmatter only — the body left free:

``` yaml
frontmatter:
  type: object
  required: [type, date]
  properties:
    type: { const: post }
    date: { type: string, format: date }
    tags:
      type: array
      items: { type: string, pattern: "^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$" }
```
