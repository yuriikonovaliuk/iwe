[![Knowledge Graph](docs/docs-detailed.svg)](https://iwe.md)

IWE turns a directory of markdown files into a knowledge graph — a connected structure you browse from your editor and your AI queries from the command line. Same files, same links, two interfaces. No cloud, no database, no lock-in. Version everything with git.

IWE is for people who want database-style queries on their notes — "all drafts under this subtree", "every accepted decision in Q1" — without moving them into an actual database. Write in **Markdown**, structure with links, give AI agents the **tools** to navigate your knowledge. IWE itself has no built-in AI — it works alongside Claude, Codex, Gemini, and any tool that speaks the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io).

## What You Get

- **Plain markdown, full ownership.** Your notes are `.md` files in a local directory. Read them, edit them, `git push` them. Nothing proprietary.
- **A graph, not a folder tree.** Link notes together and the same note can belong to multiple topics without copying the file. ([How linking works](https://iwe.md/docs/concepts/inclusion-links/))
- **IDE features for your editor.** Real LSP integration with [VS Code](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/vscode/), [Neovim](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/neovim/), [Zed](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/zed/), and [Helix](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/helix/) — search, refactor, rename, autocomplete.
- **Structured access for AI agents.** [CLI tools](https://iwe.md/docs/cli/) and an [MCP server](https://iwe.md/docs/agentic/mcp/) give agents parent context and structural navigation over the same notes you edit by hand — retrieval by structure, not similarity guessing.
- **Memory for your coding agent.** [IWE Skills](https://github.com/iwe-org/skills) a set of extensions for Claude Code and other AI agents
- **Speaks OKF.** An [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) bundle is markdown with YAML frontmatter — the format IWE already manages. `iwe init --okf` scaffolds a conformant bundle, `iwe schema validate` checks conformance mechanically, and `iwe find --filter '{type: …}'` queries OKF frontmatter directly.
- **Fast.** Built in Rust, [processes 20,000 files in under a second](docs/benchmark.md).

## How It Works

IWE treats your notes as a connected structure. You organize them with two types of links:

- **Nesting** — a link on its own line means "this topic includes that subtopic." Your notes form a tree you can browse and refactor. IWE calls these [inclusion links](https://iwe.md/docs/concepts/inclusion-links/).
- **Cross-references** — regular inline links connect notes across topics, creating a web of relationships.
- **Multiple parents** — the same note can live under several places at once. A "Meditation" note can belong to both "Health" and "Productivity" without duplicating the file.
- **Context from parents** — when you retrieve a note, IWE can include context from the notes above it in the hierarchy.

This structure makes retrieval powerful — whether you're browsing in your editor or an agent is querying via CLI, ask for a topic and get its full context in a single call.

## Working with AI

IWE gives AI agents structured access to your notes through two interfaces: a CLI for scripting and shell-based workflows, and an MCP server for native connection with AI tools. Both expose the same operations — search, retrieve, create, refactor — so you can choose whichever fits your setup.

IWE pairs **search with structure**: built-in fuzzy and full-text search finds the entry point, and the graph turns a hit into usable context — parent context, children, cross-references, link-safe refactoring. It also composes cleanly with any external tooling you already use (ripgrep, full-text, vector): whatever finds the note, IWE supplies the context around it.

### What the Engine Checks

Agent writes are checked, not trusted:

- **Declared scope.** A mutation carries `expect` guards stating how many documents and blocks it may touch. The whole update validates before anything is written; a mismatch aborts with the offending blocks named. Over MCP the guards are mandatory — an edit that won't declare its blast radius is refused.
- **Schemas.** Frontmatter and document structure are validated against per-type [document schemas](https://iwe.md/docs/concepts/document-schema/) — required fields, enums, ISO dates, required sections. A schema-violating MCP write is rejected with the violation named; from the CLI, `iwe schema validate` runs the same checks on demand.
- **Graph hygiene.** Mutations surface warnings for what they disturbed — dangling links, orphan pages — and `iwe stats similarity` flags near-duplicates.

### Integration Server (MCP)

IWE includes a server (`iwec`) that lets AI tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf work directly with your notes using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). The server watches your files for changes, so edits you make in your editor are reflected immediately.

### Command-Line Tools

The CLI lets you (and AI agents) work with your notes from the terminal or in scripts.

**Example: preparing context for an AI conversation**
```bash
iwe find --fuzzy auth

iwe retrieve --key authentication --expand-includes 2

iwe tree --key oauth
```

**Core commands:**

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `find` | Search with fuzzy and full-text ranking, plus filters over frontmatter and graph edges |
| `retrieve` | Get a document with its linked context in one call |
| `tree` | Show the hierarchy from any starting point |
| `update` | Guarded edits: frontmatter changes and targeted block operations |
| `schema` | Infer the store's schemas, or validate documents against them |

The full set — `new`, `extract`, `inline`, `rename`, `delete`, `squash`, `stats`, `normalize`, `export` and more — is in the [CLI Reference](https://iwe.md/docs/cli/).

## Editor Integration

IWE gives your editor IDE-like features for markdown notes. It works with [VS Code](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/vscode/), [Neovim](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/neovim/), [Zed](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/zed/), [Helix](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/helix/), and any editor that supports the Language Server Protocol (LSP).

- **Search** — find notes by title or content
- **Navigate** — go to definition, find references (backlinks)
- **Preview** — hover over links to see content
- **Auto-complete** — link suggestions as you type
- **Inlay hints** — show parent references and link counts
- **Extract** — pull sections into new notes
- **Inline** — embed note content back into parent
- **Rename** — rename files with automatic link updates
- **Format** — normalize documents, update link titles
- **Transform** — pipe text through external commands
- **Templates** — create notes from templates (daily notes, etc.)
- **Outline conversion** — switch between headers and lists

## Quick Start

1. **Install** the CLI and LSP server:

   Using Homebrew (macOS/Linux):
   ```bash
   brew install iwe-org/iwe/iwe
   ```

   Or using npm (macOS/Linux/Windows):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @iwe-org/iwe
   ```

   Or using Cargo:
   ```bash
   cargo install iwe iwes iwec
   ```

   Or from [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/iwe) (community-maintained — thanks, [salim-b](https://github.com/salim-b)):
   ```bash
   conda install -c conda-forge iwe
   ```

2. **Initialize** your workspace:
   ```bash
   cd ~/notes
   iwe init
   ```

3. **Pick your path:**

   **Set up your editor** — [VS Code](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/vscode/) · [Neovim](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/neovim/) · [Helix](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/helix/) · [Zed](https://iwe.md/docs/editors/zed/)

   **Connect your AI agent** — point it at the MCP server. `iwec` serves the directory it runs in, so set the working directory to your notes:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "iwe": {
         "command": "iwec",
         "cwd": "~/notes"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   No install needed — `npx` fetches the server on demand:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "iwe": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@iwe-org/mcp"],
         "cwd": "~/notes"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Give Claude Code memory** — install the plugin, then run `/iwe:init` in the repository you want remembered:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add iwe-org/skills
   /plugin install iwe@iwe-org
   ```

   Or hand the setup to the agent — paste this into Claude Code or any agent with shell access:

   ```text
   Set up IWE for my notes: install it (brew install iwe-org/iwe/iwe,
   npm install -g @iwe-org/iwe, or cargo install iwe iwes iwec), run `iwe init`
   in my notes directory, then add the `iwec` MCP server with its working
   directory set to that folder.

**Building on IWE:** projects already embed IWE — as an agent-memory backend, as the graph layer of an LLM wiki engine, in research tooling. The practical integration surfaces today are the **CLI** and the **MCP server**; the [`liwe`](https://crates.io/crates/liwe) library is published but not yet API-stable, so pin your version if you build against it. A declared, stable integration surface is on the roadmap — if you're building on IWE, [tell us](https://github.com/iwe-org/iwe/discussions/362) what you depend on, so we know what not to break.
